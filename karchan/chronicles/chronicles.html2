<H2>Introduction</H2>

Allow me to introduce myself first. I am Algol, Chronicler of the Past,
Present and Future of the Land of Karchan. Perhaps you are wondering how I
can write about events not happened yet? Sometimes I do too. The fact is
that I am Chronicler and Chairman of the Guild of Oracles. Besides the
Present, I can see the Past and the Future. That was one of the reasons why
I, of all people, was chosen to Chronicle the infinite History of the Land
of Karchan. But enough about me, let me begin with my story.

<H2>The Beginning</h2>

In the beginning there was Darkness. It is always dark in the beginning.
Don't misunderstand me. It's not like the darkness most beings currently
dwelling in the Land are used to. It is not the sort of darkness where there
comes no light forth. This was Darkness solely and alone because of  fact
that there was nobody around to look at it. And from this darkness the
omnipotent being Rakah created itself, in the form of a huge cloud.
Henceforth I will call it a she, but whether or not she was a she has never
quite clearly come forward from the story. That part is assumed by the
folklore of the people inhabiting this place, which ofcourse isn't all their
fault. If you ask me, Rakah slipped up on that part while creating them.
Well, that's not all her fault, a lot of it they have to thank to
themselves. But I must be getting ahead of my story.<P>
Where was I? Ah, yes...<P>
Rakah had created herself, and in the beginning there was just her. She
needed something to live in so she created the Universe and called it the
Universe. It was a bit cramped in there, seeing that she took up all space,
but that didn't matter that much as nobody was around to need any of it
except Rakah. After that she noticed that she did all these things at once,
and although I have some order developed in this part of the story there was
none. So, in order to make things happen after each other, she created Time
and called it Time. Time is a very convenient thing as it keeps everything
from happening all at once.

<H3>First Sense</H3>

Rakah, however, didn't know she was there, she didn't know she was anywhere,
as she didn't have any senses which allow normal beings to feel themselves.
She only knew she was in a Universe, because she build it herself. She
wished to be able to have a notion of herself, feel her presence, and she
created the First Sense, the Sense of Touch. Now, she was able to feel
herself, rubbing next to her, and have a general feeling of wholeness. She
knew now that she really felt good about herself.

<H3>Second Sense</H3>

Rakah now could feel, but she couldn't see what. Rakah looked about itself
and saw nothing. Which wasn't all that strange, seeing there was Darkness
and everything, nobody could see a thing. This was clearly not very good,
and Rakah created for itself the Second Sense, the Sense of Sight, in order
to see what was going on. Along with the Sense of Sight, Rakah created,
without apparently knowing about it, the things to see, white and black,
colour, light and darkness. Finally Rakah got a good look at herself. She
seemed to be made of a fleeting gas with all sorts of small floating dots of
light in it. She could see where she would float past herself, she could see
the dim points of light floating inside her. Finally she could see what it
was all about.

<H3>Third Sense</H3>

Finally, she created the Third Sense, the Sense of Hearing. She didn’t do
this out of sore need, not because she needed it or anything. It was just
incomplete. She could feel what was happening, and she could see what was
happening, but in order to bind these two together, to have a connection
between the seeing and feeling, she needed a third sense. And at the same
time she created sounds, without knowing it. She could hear herself,
floating by, roaring by at great speed, and gently stopping. She could hear
as well as see and feel the different points of light inside herself. This
gave her great joy.

<H3>Fourth Sense</H3>

Finally, she got bored with all these senses. She could see from a distance,
she could hear from a distance, the only sense which was a little more
physical was the sense of feeling. She wanted more physical senses. So she
created the Fourth Sense, the Sense of Taste. Now she could taste the
darkness in front of her.

<H3>Fifth Sense</H3>

Finally, she created the Fifth Sense, the Sense of Smell. In order to
supplement the Fourth Sense. 

<H3>Genesis</H3>

She thought she had enough senses now and she quit with them and started to
see what was out there. Apparently that wasn't that much and she got very
bored with herself, the only being in the entire Universe. What good were
senses if there was nothing around to practice them with?<P>

Then she, after her own image, created a dot of light, except that this dot
was really big. It was a sphere, totally white and giving off so much light
that even Rakah has some problems looking into it. She looked at it, and she
thought she had created the most boutiful thing ever to grace her eyes.
Which wasn't all that strange, seeing it was the only thing she created yet.

But quickly her interest waned. The white sphere, which we now know as Sun
and which probably comes from the Elven dialect meaning in the Common Speech
lightsphere, was very dull at last. Nothing was happening, you just could
look at it, or don't look at it. Rakah needed a new challenge, something
that would evolve in time, Rakah sought something to divert her attention
and created a single planet in a large black darkness, which would run
around the sun in circles. The Elves called the planet Kuri which translates
as mother in the Common Speech. After that she created the land, brown soil,
and the water to fill the bigger gaps in the texture of the planet, and the
sky, air and clouds of vapour, to wrap itself around the planet. After that
was done, out of her own matter, she created two shapeless forms. Then she
took two points of light from herself and put each one in one of the
shapeless forms, and planted the shapeless forms onto the planet she created
in a small clearing in the middle of the land. And she watched to see what
would happen.

<H3>Karn and Zhanos</H3>

In a small clearing in the middle of the land the two shapeless forms were
beginning to come to life, the small points of light lighting up strongly
within them. They were still gas-like and had no solid shape yet. In the
beginning they were made of the same matter as Rakah, but they discovered
that that matter was governable into any form or type they wanted. They were
now also capable of forming themselves into any shape they wanted. They both
became very different shapes in all sizes and after some experimenting, they
tried to agree on the shape that they would assume for most of the time. A
shape that was agreeable to them both, and they found out a shape,
consisting of a large body, with four cylindrical shapes coming out of it
and a small sphere on top. After a while, and much shifting of matter, they
managed to make something out of themselves.<P>

The two beings called themselves Karn and Zhanos, and they had, just as
Rakah, the power to create and to destroy. They looked at the land and both
thought it a desolate place. But while Zhanos liked it, Karn sought to
improve it with things that would enlivy it a bit. Zhanos was not at all
pleased at this, as he liked the desolation and all and loathed changing it.
Karn would create things and Zhanos would undo them. At last Karn could take
it no longer, and formed some vocal cords. And then they created, between
theirselves, the first fight.<P>

'Why do you destroy all that I have created?', spoke Karn for the first
time, with a high clear sound as the sound of a knife gently being striken
against a crystal glass. Zhanos was shocked at the new development, also
formed some vocal chords, less adept then Karn but still functional.<BR>
'Because I like it the way it is, and I don't want you to meddle with it!',
said Zhanos with a harsh and uncomforting sound. Karn sighed.<BR>
'But what do you want from me? I mean, look at this place, it is totally
clear that Rakah meant us to do something with it, in order to amuse her.'.
'I am telling you to leave it the way it is, it is nice and desolate, and I
like it!! If you start changing it again, I'll have to try and stop
you!'.<P>
At this, Karn was shocked yet his brow darkened and his face stood resolute,
not bent on giving in into the whims of his brother.<BR>
'Well, then, maybe you should go ahead and try!', said Karn to Zhanos. And
then commences the very first fight, and one of the best, ever told in the
entire history of Karchan, it was also the last time that two beings of such
terrible powers came in contact with each other. The exact choreographie of
the fight is not given here, as it reaches far above our concepts of
fighting. Some people say that they used their vast minds to trick each
other, and that the entire battle took place between them without moving.
And if that is what you want to believe, then go ahead because I am not
about to write anything down to try and mar this great event with words that
are totally inadequate. <P>
Oh, well, where was I?<P>

Ah, yes, after the planet went round the sun for 28 times, they stopped
fighting. Both in extremely good health and both unable to get the other one
to yield. Apparently, they both were made of the same stuff, and were
completely equal to each other. There was no difference between the two,
except maybe in their minds. And as they were exactly the same, they were an
exact match for each other. It was impossible to get a victory over it. But
then Rakah, seeing that the amusement has stopped and that there never would
be a conqueror, she choose between Karn and Zhanos. And she choose Karn.
Karn and Zhanos immediately were aware of the choice that was made by Rakah,
and Zhanos turned aside, his expression horribly changed in a mix of hatred
against Rakah and Karn, and surprise, and the knowledge of the fact that he
wasn't choosen. This bitter memory he cherished forever and from this point
on his hatred never diminished or increased, it was eternal. He walked away
from the clearing that day and withdrew far away in the rocky mountains in
the South of the land, never to be seen for a long time.

<H3>Tale of Creation</H3>

Karn was alone in the clearing. Above him he could see the thousands of
light points in the darkness of Rakah.

Note on pronunciation<P>

The following note is intended simply to clarify a few main features in the
pronunciation of names in the Elvish languages, and is by no means
exhaustive.<P>

<H3>Consonants</H3>
<DL>
<DT>C
<DD>always has the value of <I>k</I>, never of <I>s</I>; thus
<I>Celeborn</I> is '<I>Keleborn</I>', not
'<I>Seleborn</I>'. In a few cases, as <I>Tulkas</I>, <I>Kementari</I> a
<I>k</I> has been used in the spelling of this book.
<DT>CH
<DD>always had the value of <I>ch</I> in Scotch <I>loch</I> or German
<I>buch</I>, never that of <I>ch</I> in English <I>church</I>. Examples are
<I>Carcharoth, Erchamion</I>.
<DT>DH
<DD>is always used to represent the sound of a voiced ('soft') <I>th</I> in
English, that is the <I>th</I>  in <I>then</I>, not the <I>th</I> in
<I>thin</I>. Examples are <I>Maedhros, Aredhel, Haudh-en-Arwen</I>.
<DT>G
<DD>always has the sound of English <I>g</I> in <I>get</I>; thus <I>Region,
Eregion</I> are not pronounced like the English <I>region</I>, and the first
syllable of <I>Ginglith</I> is as in English <I>begin</I>, not as in
<I>gin</I>.
</DL>
<H3>Vowels</H3>
<DL>
<DT>AI
<DD>has the sound of English <I>eye</I>; thus the second syllable of
<I>Edain</I> is like English <I>dine</I>, not <I>Dane</I>.
<DT>AU
<DD>has the value of English <I>ow</I> in <I>town</I>; thus the first
syllable of <I>aule</I>  is like English <I>owl</I>, and the first syllable
of <I>Sauron</I> is like English <I>sour</I>, not <I>sore</I>.
<DT>EI
<DD>as in <I>Teiglin</I> has the sound of English <I>grey</I>.
<DT>IE
<DD>should not be pronounced as in English <I>piece</I>
