elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

Well, my home internet account has been reactivated, so I can maintain
everything from home again.<p>
Made some stupid mistakes in the php scripts. Fixed it, and the who list and
everything works again.<p>

Great! Just great! Well, here comes some of the crap I've had to deal with:
<UL>
<LI>my home cable internet connection is gone (they have shut me off because
I was sending bad ips onto the network. I managed to trace the problem to a
bad netmask, but they still have to reconnect me. What is it for way of
working to
first shut a persons connection down, and provide information only when I
call. Sheesh, the calls alone are a disaster. Helpdesk reconnects me to the
Technical Support. Technical Support reconnects me to the Misuse Department.
Still isn't fixed, will have to call Tuesday.)
Thank god I have Internet at work. 
<LI>my hosting company had an issue with their UPS, causing a reboot of
several machines (not only mine). Seems to have been fixed and I restarted
the mud server.
<LI>I'll see what I can do about the who list.
</UL>
Oh, and by the by, thank you for all the emails mentioning that Karchan was
down. It shows that people are still playing the game.

Well, I decided to clean the place up. The bantable has been reset so
everyone can join the game. However, it probably means that the bantable
will be filled again quite quick as well. I also did a cleanup of everyone
who has not been online for the past 90 days, that should clean the place a
little up.<p>I'll see about being a little more active regarding this place.

Well, I got the emailaccounts up and running again. 
(you know, <A HREF="mailto:deputy@karchan.org">deputy@karchan.org</A>
 and all that stuff.) I cannot make any promises about answering emails
ofcourse.<P>Also added PHP support
to the Apache server. If this does not mean anything to you, well, let me
tell you it is damn cool stuff. I am redoing the whole cgi-script thingy in
php as it takes way too much time to maintain. Check out the who list on the
main page for an example.

Well, the initial problem was a little one. The disk partition was full.
After deleting some files I restarted the server and suddenly nothing
worked.
<P>
Well, I have no idea what is wrong, but after some god-awful hack I got
things working for now. I have to get this program redone in Java and rather
right now, before the whole thing comes crashing down. Anyone care to help?<P>
In how far would you people mind if I get a preliminary version done in Java
that works flawlessly, but most of the functionality will be gone? Or would
you rather have the current situation, a shitty server program that restarts
itself every 30 minutes but has items and whatnot.<P>

w00t! w00t! The Cable Guy came by last Thursday and installed everything
perfectly. I had to do some fiddlin' but I got it working right away.<P>
All I have got to do now, is create the proper setup.<P>
You would not believe how fast the connection is! The Speed is making me
quite dizzy!! Some preliminary figures point to a download of 300 Kbytes/s.
<P>
I should be satisfied with my setup tomorrow evening, so I can devote some
more time to the mud!

Essent @ Home called me on Saturday. Apparently the cable guy is going

*sigh* It's about bleeding time.

Saturday, Feb 15, 00:15<P>
Well, apparently I had to do some more stuff to get that thing fixed. It
should be fixed <I>permanently</I> now and healing and
encumberance and all the other stuff should work again.<P>
Regarding the items, apparently the items table was empty when I looked.
I had to put back a backup from the previous day. It did not seem to
be a database problem though.<P>
Regarding my Cable Internet. It seems I will really receive a phone
call one of these days. Here's to hopin'.

Well, some people claimed that the stats did not improve

I don't know if any of you noticed but the game seems
to become less and less responsive when more and more
people are active. This is due to the fact that the
server is single-threaded. (i.e. it executes a command
sent by a user and then proceeds to the next)<P>

I have recently made the mud multi-threaded. Every
command to be executed is handled by a different
thread. So, several threads (i.e. commands) can be
handled in parallel which should increase the
responsiveness of the game wonderfully.<P>

However, this stuff is ofcourse still in beta so I
have to do some stuff with it to find out if all is
well.<P>
On a side note, I only got a cdrom and manual with my 
cable internet because the repair-guy is supposed
to bring all the necessary equipment I need with him.
I am just waiting for a phonecall so I can make
an appointment. Do you think he will call before
the end of the year?<P>
Anyway, to everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
<BR>Karn.

Got a package in the mail yesterday from Essent Cable Internet. I was
really happy.<P>
Opened it. Turned out to contain nothing but a <I>manual</I> for Karn's
sake! What do I want with a manual? I
need a cable modem and hardware, not a bloody manual.<P>
I am sad again.

All righty then.<P>

The Game now has a <FONT COLOR="red">Land of Karchan -
Main Soundtrack</FONT>. The full mp3 version is available <A
HREF="/sound/mp3/Echoes_of_the_Past.mp3">here</A>, but a small wav version
of the first thirty seconds is available <A
HREF="/sound/wav/echoes.wav">here</A>. Ofcourse, the mp3 has much better
quality.<P>

Where did I get this? At my place of work I know a
person who calls himself <FONT COLOR="red">Redheat</FONT>, who makes
Synthesizer music. He was kind enough to license two of his tracks to me for
free distribution on my karchan.org website. You can find his website at
<A HREF="http://www.red-heat.com">http://www.red-heat.com</A>. He has
more scrumptious music to be downloaded there.<P>

Bear in mind that I have licensed his music so I am allowed to
distribute these two tracks through my website. If you wish to use these
sound tracks as well, you will have to contact him yourself.<P>

I hope you all like the music.<P>
<I>What did you think of the LOK Main Soundtrack?</I><P>

For the past two years I have yearned for a permanent Internet connection
at home, but been unable to get it at this backwater village
in nowhere-country.<P>
This summer, my cable company replaced most of the cable in the vicinity.<P>
Took a telephone yesterday and called to my local Cable company asking for
CableInternet Access. Turns out it will be available in December of this
year. Then I will have a dedicated 1-2 Mbit/s line. That day will be a day
of celebration and probably one of the best Christmas gifts ever.<P>
If they have the heart to postpone it (again) I will fall into a deep pit
of despair, plotting the demise of Cable TV Executives as I plummet down.

Seeing as important and possibly security sensitive information has
been removed from the source code and put into a nice config file, I
don't see why I cannot provide people (read) access
to the CVS Repository. The CVS Repository is the place where I work
(and the deps, when they feel like it) on the source code. As such it
always carries the latest and greatest changes. How this works can
be found at www.cvshome.org .
<P>
Here is the info for you to access my source code through CVS:
<UL>
<LI>username: anonymous
<LI>password: no password, just don't fill out anything
<LI>proper commandline: <I>cvs
-d :pserver:anonymous@www.karchan.org:/karchan/mud/cvsroot
&lt;command&gt;</I>
<LI>(You are ofcourse free to use another program to access
my sourcecode. I hear WinCVS and TurtleCVS are quite nice Windows GUIs)
</UL>
For example getting the latest documentation:<BR>
<I>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.karchan.org:/karchan/mud/cvsroot login<BR>

Some more good news: the mudmail seems to be fixed. I caught the bug
and at the same time (as I was bored, anyway) I added some, I think,
nice features to the mudmail system.
<HR>
Some good news: I think I have most of the bugs that were causing freezes
and the white-screen-of-death. The game should be running more stable now.
*crosses fingers*
<P>
One of the little changes that you might have noticed is the extra
little piece of text at the top of your screen. It
contains the Version Number and last Compile Date/Time stamp
of the new mud engine. <P>
Sometimes the game will freeze up. This means that I screwed up and one of
the commands used is the cause. What happens is that I fix
it immediately and restart the game server. However, between the
game freezing up and me resetting the game the game is unavailable.<P>

Let's hope that this does not happen again for some time. Time will tell
if the new power supply really fixed the problem.<P>
Regards and have fun once again!<P>

Well, that was quite a scare, wasn't it? The server had crashed
approximately Tuesday, the 26th of March 2002. I
went and had a look. Apparently there were some
hardware problems, but after
some fiddling, dustblowing and shaking the little server seemed to
be functioning again.<P>
I did make use of the opportunity to install a new version
of the OS, and the thing seems to be stable. Let us hope it stays that
way, and that this hardware failure was just an accident. Otherwise
we might be in trouble.<P>
Suffice to say that I have not fixed everything yet, most
of the basic stuff should work, I think.<P>
<HR>
Well, that was quite a scare, wasn't it? Apparently the database received
too many connections resulting in new connections not being accepted any
more.<P>
I rebooted the database server and everything seems to work again, though I
did have to put a backup of the tmp_usertable back. All other information
should be in tact for as far as I know. <P>

Rightyho. A New Year has arrived and <FONT COLOR="red">the quest is
ready</Font>. Meaning that there is now a cure for the disease that everyone
is suffering from. For the first clue, I suggest that you visit the castle.<P>
<HR>
Rightyho. A New Year has arrived and I am close to finishing the quest that
will take care of this nasty disease that has been going around. Check back
here on info when the quest is finished.<P>

Rightyho. I am back from Tenerife and have turned a wonderfull shade of
red.<P>
<HR>
Rightyho. I will be off to Tenerife from December 3rd until the 11th, so you   
people know. I'll be sitting at the beach in the sun with a Pina Colada in
my hand, while all you people are shivering in the cold. Muhahaha!<P>     
<HR>
Right! I got around to doing some programming. It has been a long time, but
I finally got myself to do something constructive. The Leather Shop in
Pendulis has a new item called 'brown leather common sack'. Why is this
important, you may ask yourself. Well, this item is a <I>container</I>.
Which means that it can contain other items. There are two new commands
available that may help you with containers, called '<I>put</I>' and
'<I>retrieve</I>'.<P>
This is all still highly <I>buggy</I>, so do report bugs if you find
them.<P>
<HR>
I'd also like to say 'Hi!' to Blackfyre who has joined the ranks of
deputies.<P>
<HR>
There is the possibility to add your personal data to the website!
It is called a <I>Character Sheet</I>. Fill one in or check out the other 
people that already have one. You can find it <A

All righty! I am back from Lowlands.
<HR>
All righty! I am off to Lowlands this weekend having fun and listening to
music with friends. See y'all after the weekend.<P>
<HR>
Yep! The game is back online (sorta) and the operating system has been
updated. Still need to do some tweaking but 
it is workable again. Please email me if you notice that some things are 
still not working as they should.<P>
I hope this means the end of those database/harddisk errors we've been
getting.
<HR>
Yep! I am back from my vacation in France. Ready to do some stuff. Made some
nice pictures that might come in handy for the mud.<P>
<HR>
On a related note, I'm off to the south of France for a week to do some
mountain climbing. I hope the
mud holds together. Expect me back somewhere around the 7th of July.<P>
<HR>
<FONT COLOR=blue><B>Oh, <I>BLUE</I> is back! Yes, people, blue is back on request of
lots of people. Ofcourse, it is only a matter of time before I decide to 
switch again. ;-)</B><P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=red>To those of you that do not know, the itemtable of the
database was corrupted. I fixed the problem, but I do not know how much
information was lost in the process. Will check and perhaps put back a
backup.<P>
On a related subject, I just changed the password authorization procedure.
You now have two passwords, the regular one that you use to log on, and a
<I>session password</I> that is only valid during the time that you play 
on the game and that is generated by the game itself when you log on.
<P>Advantage of this is that your <I>real</I> password will only be transmitted
once, namely during logon. After that, the game uses the Session
Password.<P>
Update: Another thing has been added to the password authorisation scheme.
This makes use of cookies. It is now officially impossible to play the game
without you having Cookie-support enabled in your browser. Luckily, in most
cases it is set to on.

Okay, I implemented a parser type thingy for the mud. I had to rewrite all
the existing special commands to this new parser, and that is why the
special commands were temporarily disabled.<P>
They work again, now. If you find any bugs, please report them to me.<P>
<FONT COLOR=green>Oh, and by the way, what do you all think of the <B><I>new colour</I></B>?<P></FONT>
<HR>
I did a mondo big cleanup of the database and removed every character that
was inactive for more then 90 days (i.e. about 3 months). 
It was badly needed.<P>
Oh, and then one other thing. It seems that the pictures in some of the 
titles of the players are malfunctioning. Apparently this is due to
<I>geocities</I>. They no longer allow other webpages to link to pictures
on their webspace. One solution would be to seek out another free web
provider.
<HR>
Yes! And Welcome Back! The server was down for quite some time this time.
I did a complete reinstall seeing as the Filesystem was totally gone to hell
in a hand basket. The reason that it took so long, is that I am currently
busy moving to a new house. I had to move my ISDN with me as well, and
ofcourse the dudes from Telecom company screwed it up. 
Everything seems to be fixed now, regarding ISDN but the game will need some
additional tweaking.
<HR>
Well, obviously I have got the game working again on the new server. Y'all
have a good time now, yah hear?<P>
Oh, by the way, I'm back from Italy. Going away to America (Florida/Miami)
sometime 18th of November, but right now I'm back again.<P>

<HR>
Hmmm, strange, as far as I can tell it seems as if the fighting works again.
<HR>
Oh, by the way, I'm back from America.<P>
<HR>
Oh, by the way, I'm off to Italy for a week. Will try to check how things
are going but might not be able to.<P>
<HR>
Yep, the game was down, and it was all due to my fault. 
I have it fixed now, though.
<HR>
The fighting is back in working order, still needs a little work though.<P>
<I>Karn (Ruler of Karchan, Keeper of the Key to the Room of Lost

By the by, I am going away for approximately 11 days to a Popfestival in
Danmark. Will try to see if I cannot log onto the game from there, but no
promises, ofcourse.<P>

eputyship is one of the most sought after things on the mud as far as I can
tell. People often come to me with the request that I make them a deputy. I
often have to explain that the requirements are pretty steep. However!!!
Right now, as of the beginning of the month, there are a number of
<B>NEW</B> requirements!!! Anyone who wishes to become a deputy, besides all
the other requirements, has to pay a fee of 35$ for the first month, and 20$
every month after that. Keep that in mind when you ask me.
<HR>
Furthermore, I'd like to welcome the following new deputies on board that seem to have the required skills and are able to pay the fees requested. It is quite likely that you might be seeing their influence on the game.

I am out for the weekend, going to a nice Popfestival. I hope to be back alive and kicking Monday and to finally do something structured with the fighting in order to get it back in working order.<P>
