Well, haven't changed this little file in a lot of time. Anyway, apparently

31-08-1998:<BR>
Sorry to keep you so long, but Zahnos, my evil Twin Brother, has
accidentally deleted all the room descriptions. I've put back an old version
of these room descriptions and you should be all righty now.<P>
Other than that I'm still working on the database. In fact, this is the
first time in probably two months that I have found the time to be back at
my little old server and do some serious stuff.<P>

30-09-1998:<BR>
The new beta version of the mud is now actively in effect. Some commands or
capabilities have not been implemented yet. Besides that everyone's
inventories have disappeared off into the sunset. <P>
All of you must have noticed that there were problems on 29 September 1998.
These problems were database related. Apparently the database was filling up
my memory
pretty fast, resulting in a Out of Threads/Memory error message. For all you
technical people out there, it's a long standing bug of Redhat 5.1, MySQL
and glib-2.0.7-13 and
I upgraded to glibc-2.0.7-19 fixing the entire thing. <P>
