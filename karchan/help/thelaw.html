The Law</H1>
(unless otherwise stated below, the offending player will receive 
warnings to seize and dissist breaking a rule before steps are taken)<P>

<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+2>Thou art responsible for the actions of thyne character at all
times!</FONT><BR>
	The actions of the characters are, and always will be, the responsibility of
the persons that created them. <P>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+2>Thou willt treat what deputies tell thee as being law!</FONT><BR>
Their decisions are final, there is no parool or appeal possible. If you
dislike how they rule, you have the right to stop playing this mud.<P>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+2>Thou shalt not harass people!</FONT><BR>
	For those of you who don't know what harassing is, here's a definition:<P>
<I>harassing = if people think that you are harassing them, then you are
harassing them!</I><P>
Abusive words, slang, or any other kind of language with the purpose to
harass and be hurtfull also fall under this header.<P>
If the offense is sufficiently severe this is grounds for <B>IMMEDIATE
BANISHMENT</B> from the game!<P>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+2>Thou shalt not try to break/hack into the MUD</FONT><BR>
	Attempting to break/hack into the MUD and failing also falls under this
header. Attempting to break/hack into the MUD "just for fun" or "because I
was bored" or "to see if I could" also fall under this header. Breaking this
rule is grounds for <B>IMMEDIATE BANISHMENT</B> from the game!<P>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+2>Thou shalt not cheat</FONT><BR>
	Cheating will not be tolerated. If you find a bug, report it, then do
not use it. No multiple logins, multiple playings, or helping your own
characters with other characters you own. <P>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+2>Thou shalt not give out quest solutions.</FONT><BR>
	If a fellow player is stuck on a quest it is allowed to give him small
hints. It is also allowed for multiple players who do not know the solution
to combine their search in a particular quest. <P>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+2>Thou shalt type Quit, every time thou leavest this great game.</FONT><BR>
	If you don't and try to log in at a later time, the computer will
indicate that another session is still active. This is more a
<I>Guideline</I> then a solid black-and-white rule.<P>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+2>Ignorance of these here written and unwritten rules is no excuse.</FONT><BR>
	Changes to these rules are at the discretions of the creator. Make
sure to keep updated. <P>
