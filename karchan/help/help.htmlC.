<A HREF="#TABLE"><A NAME="Quest"><H2>The Quest</H2></A></A>
What would a MUD be if it didn't have some deeper meaning behind it? What
people on this MUD need is a goal, something to strive for, something to
achieve. Well, that goal is there, that goal is becoming a wizard.<P>
How do you become a wizard? Very good question, well, a wizard needs a book
of magic. In this case <B>The Book of Magic</B>, also called <B>The Book of
the Old Ways</B>, but everybody uses an other name, it is
called:<P><H1><Center>Kyragem</Center></H1>This book you have to get. To do
this you have to boldly go where no man has gone before. You have to look at
hidden places, give people things and ask for favors. Use the <B>help
hint</B> option often if you want to get any where. And maybe, just maybe,
you will be the next in line to become a full born and bread wizard.

<A HREF="#TABLE"><A NAME="Move"><H2>Moving Through the MUD</H2></A></A>
Moving through the MUD is quite simple.<P>
You can go west, east, south and north, and that is it. If you can't pass at
one time it is possible that the way is blocked. Find something to free it
and you will be free to travel anywhere you like. Do not try anything like
<B>move to the bar</B> or <B>move east</B> or <B>go to the shop</B> because
this will never work. If it does work, it will be because there are right
and left directions as to how it should be done.<P>
One more thing, if by any change, you succeed in doing something special,
like open a hidden doorway, it is of no use to you to use the words
<B>move towards doorway</B>, what you should do, is look carefully at the
thing you have just places, or pulled, or opened, and in the text will be
written that there is <B>a way up or down, east, north, south or west</B>.
That is the way and the only way to do it.

<A HREF="#TABLE"><A NAME="Com"><H2>Communication</H2></A></A>
It isn't very hard to communicate to one another. There are a few simple
commands that detail this. (<I>See</I>
<A HREF="#List">List of all possible commands</A>) A third party 
can hear what you say to somebody else. If you
whisper, however, that will not be the case. He will hear that you are
whispering something, but he can't make out what it is. <P>
<B>One more thing</B>: It is a tricky bussiness to talk to the 'Bots. Bots are
people that are a fixture in this game. They are not real. They should be
able to do simple tasks and you can ask them somethings or say things to them,
but it is very likely that they won't say something back. However, I (The
maker of this MUD) update the responses of every character every few hours,
so if at one time he doesn't answer any of your summons, perhaps the next
day he will. Important is it that you always talk <B>to</B> a fixed
character. Like this: <B>say to <I>Bill Hello</I></B> and this will ilicet
some sort of response. Don not use any quotes like ' or &quot; and no use of
questionmarks (like ?) or exclamationmarks (like !) or , or . or whatever,
as that will illicet no response whatsoever. And by the way, short sentences
will always work better than long ones.

<A HREF="#TABLE"><A NAME="Money"><H2>Money</H2></A></A>
Try selling things to the shopkeeper. You will get a certain amount of
copper, silver and gold coins for your trouble. If you type <B>list</B> you
will be able to see what can be bought. If you have any more question, try
reading the sign in the shop. It is a small discription of how you should
operate within the shop.

<A HREF="#TABLE"><A NAME="Law"><H2>The Law of the Land of
Karchan</H2></A></A>
The actions of the characters are, and always will be, the responsibility of
the persons behind them. Luckily I (Karn), Manatoba and since recently
Meadel are here to guard this
place, so, if you are killing/harassing someone, or abusing the game for
your own bad ways, you will eventually be punished severly. The decisions
made by me or Manatoba or Meadel are binding to everyone on the mud, however bad our
conduct may be in the eyes of the 'innocent' victim of our actions. There are a few
things you have to abide by:
<UL>
<LI>No abusive words, slang, or any kind
<LI>No harassing people
<LI>Always abide by Netiquette (See below)
<LI>Do not corrupt this Mud
<LI>Do not try to break into/hack the MUD
</UL>
<H3>Netiquette</H3>
Netiquette is what you behave like on this Mud, or anywhere else on the
Internet in general. The following rules could be considered as
guidelines:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Always make sure that people can understand you.
<LI>Do not use abusive language.
<LI>Never ever do anything to people, if they do not want you to.
<LI>Don't type anything which somebody has asked you to type, unless you are
very sure of yourself.
<LI>Do not make fun of people.
<LI>Do not harass people
</OL>
<H3>The Knights of Karchan</H3>
The Second party in command of this mud is the Knights of Karchan, they are
the one that roam the land all day and have a special room in the castle.
They have the ability to kill or hurt people vehemently if they cross the
thin line between mildly annoying and vehemently harassing. They only answer
to Karn or Manatoba.
<H3>Definitions</H3>
harassing = if people think that you are harassing them, then you are
harassing them!<BR>

Front of Church<BR>
The oldest stone church in the Walled City dates back to 1587. An
intricately carved
     door opens to the church. Of great interest are the baroque pulpit,
trompel'oeil
     paintings,molave choir stalls and an 18th century pipe organ. The
monastery houses
     impressive collection of religious and secular art. <BR>
