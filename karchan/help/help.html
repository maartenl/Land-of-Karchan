<A NAME="preface"><H2><A HREF="#TABLE">Preface</A></H2>
Welcome to the General Guide of the mud. Here you will find an explanation
of the most current commands as well as how to live and prosper in the land and
enhance your character. Please bear in mind that this guide is a work in
progress and as such is subject to constant change.
<P>
<I>Disclaimer<P>
Neither me (Karn), not the deputies are responsible for the players in the
game. All we provide is the architecture/medium or whatever you call it to
communicate with other players, play the game, or engage in RolePlaying.<P>
This means that it is quite likely that you will meet other people that are
either rude, lewd, offensive, disgusting or unpleasant in other ways. If they 
behave in this way directly towards you, you may ask them to stop it. If they
fail to comply, this is called 'harassment' and is grounds for banishment
from the game. You can request help from a deputy in this case. However, if
people are unpleasant in an indirect way you can either request that they leave
the room and continue someplace else, or you can yourself leave the room.
This is not ground for banishment.<P>
</I>
<A NAME="chap1"><H2><A HREF="#TABLE">Chapter 1. How to do What</A></H2>

<A NAME="chap11"><H3><A HREF="#chap1">Moving Through the MUD</A></H3

Moving through the MUD is quite simple.<P>
You can go west, east, south and north, and that is it. If you can't pass at
one time it is possible that the way is blocked. Find something to free it
and you will be free to travel anywhere you like. Do not try anything like
<B>move to the bar</B> or <B>move east</B> or <B>go to the shop</B> because
this will never work. If it does work, it will be because there are right
and left directions as to how it should be done.<P>
One more thing, if by any change, you succeed in doing something special,
like open a hidden doorway, it is of no use to you to use the words
<B>move towards doorway</B>, what you should do, is look carefully at the
thing you have just places, or pulled, or opened, and in the text will be
written that there is <B>a way up or down, east, north, south or west</B>.
That is the way and the only way to do it.

<A NAME="chap12"><H3><A HREF="#chap1">Communication</A></H3>
It isn't very hard to communicate to one another. There are a few simple
commands that detail this. (<I>See</I>
<A HREF="#List">List of all possible commands</A>) A third party 
can hear what you say to somebody else. If you
whisper, however, that will not be the case. He will hear that you are
whispering something, but he can't make out what it is. <P>
<B>One more thing</B>: It is a tricky bussiness to talk to the 'Bots. Bots are
people that are a fixture in this game. They are not real. They should be
able to do simple tasks and you can ask them somethings or say things to them,
but it is very likely that they won't say something back. However, I (The
maker of this MUD) update the responses of every character every few hours,
so if at one time he doesn't answer any of your summons, perhaps the next
day he will. Important is it that you always talk <B>to</B> a fixed
character. Like this: <B>say to <I>Bill Hello</I></B> and this will ilicet
some sort of response. Don not use any quotes like ' or &quot; and no use of
questionmarks (like ?) or exclamationmarks (like !) or , or . or whatever,
as that will illicet no response whatsoever. And by the way, short sentences
will always work better than long ones.

<A NAME="chap13"><H3><A HREF="#chap1">How to get Money</A></H3>
Try selling things to the shopkeeper. You will get a certain amount of
copper, silver and gold coins for your trouble. If you type <B>list</B> you
will be able to see what can be bought. If you have any more question, try
reading the sign in the shop. It is a small discription of how you should
operate within the shop.

<A NAME="chap2"><H2><A HREF="#TABLE">Chapter 2. Quests</A></H2>

<A NAME="chap21"><H3><A HREF="#chap2">Normal Quests</A></H3>
Normal quests are used in the game. They are usually created by one specific
deputy and they are generally quite short and are easily to solve. Some
general rules to solve most quests:
<OL>
<LI>look at things in rooms, they usually carry descriptions that mean
something (for example 'look at chest')
<LI>search things, especially usefull if you have looked at them and seem to
see something odd (for example, 'search road')
<LI>when looking at things, sometimes the description tells you what to do.
Some rooms have special commands that will only work in that room with a
combination of certain items that you have etcetera.
</OL>

Solving of a quest generally means that you gain a certain number of
experience points and perhaps even so many experience points that you level.

<A NAME="chap22"><H3><A HREF="#chap2">Special Quests</A></H3>
A Special Quest is a Quest that effects Every/Most Player in the Game! As such
these special quests are carried out in possible combination between me
(Karn) and some/all of the deputies. It is usually more complicated then a
normal quest and is usually extended throughout the game area.<P>

A good example of a special quest is/was <I>The Whiteblodge Plague</I>.

<A NAME="chap23"><H3><A HREF="#chap2">The Quest</A></H3>
What would a MUD be if it didn't have some deeper meaning behind it? What
people on this MUD need is a goal, something to strive for, something to
achieve. Well, that goal is there, that goal is becoming a wizard.<P>
How do you become a wizard? Very good question, well, a wizard needs a book
of magic. <P>
Right now it is still impossible to retrieve the Book of Magic, seeing as I
haven't finished implementing it yet. Come back for this guide at a later
date when it has been updated.
<P>
<A NAME="chap3"><H2><A HREF="#TABLE">Chapter 3. Netiquette</A>
</H2>
Netiquette is what you behave like on this Mud, or anywhere else on the
Internet in general. The following rules could be considered as
guidelines:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Always make sure that people can understand you.
<LI>Do not use abusive language.
<LI>Never ever do anything to people, if they do not want you to.
<LI>Don't type anything which somebody has asked you to type, unless you are
very sure of yourself.
<LI>Do not make fun of people.
<LI>Do not harass people
</OL>
<A NAME="chap31"><H3><A HREF="#chap3">The Law</A></H3>
Yes, there is a <I>Law</I> in the land of Karchan. Every player as well as
the deputies and me has to try and be true to this law. The law(s) can be
found at <A HREF="/karchan/help/thelaw.html">The Law of Karchan</A>.
Remember, ignorance of the law is no excuse.<P>

<A NAME="chap32"><H3><A HREF="#chap3">The Knights of Karchan</A></H3>
The Second party in command of this mud is the Knights of Karchan, they are
the one that roam the land all day and have a special room in the castle.
They have the ability to kill or hurt people vehemently if they cross the
thin line between mildly annoying and vehemently harassing. 

<A NAME="appA"><H2><A HREF="#TABLE">Appendix A. Terminology</A></H2>
Over the years, some players of the game have started to develop their own
abbreviations in dayly Karchanian life. For some of these, nobody knows
where the term originally came from, for most of them they are closely
related with approximately the same terms as used in other muds.
<DL>
<DT>AFK
<DD>short for <B>A</B>way <B>f</B>rom <B>K</B>eyboard
<DT>brb
<DD>short for <B>B</B>e <B>R</B>ight <B>B</B>ack
<DT>HTML
<DD>HTML, <I>H</I>yper<I>T</I>ext <I>M</I>arkup <I>L</I>anguage, designed
to make life easier and internet more interesting. It uses commands to
design text-files (or better said HTML-files) with different fonts and
text-styles and images. Every command commences with a &lt; and ends
in a &gt;. If you are using Netscape you should be able to see the different
commands in this file. Everything is proparly explained in
<A HREF="http://www.il.fontys.nl/~maartenl/htmlprim.html">this link</A>.
Important to know is that in this game of mine, communication can
also use special commands from HTML.
<DT>Huskies 
<DD>persons who do not type quit and still shutdown their
browser/internet connection but stay active.
<DT>Karchanian 
<DD>persons who have played or are playing the game are referred to as
Karchanians
<DT>Lag
<DD>slow responses, due to a bad and slow connection.
<DT>LL Karchan

Front of Church<BR>
The oldest stone church in the Walled City dates back to 1587. An
intricately carved
     door opens to the church. Of great interest are the baroque pulpit,
trompel'oeil
     paintings,molave choir stalls and an 18th century pipe organ. The
monastery houses
     impressive collection of religious and secular art. <BR>
