Hello, and welcome to the <I>Karchan WebRing</I>. Now, I noticed that there are a
few people out there who have HomePages that point directly to this here
game. These homepages contain (most of the good ones, anyway) important
information concerning the Game, concerning the Chronicles, concerning this
or that private Guild somebody has founded along with a member list and
everything.<P>

In order for everybody to be able to locate these HomePages, I have gone so far as
to bring to life the <I>Karchan WebRing</I>. If you want to be a part of
this WebRing, please email me (<I><A
HREF="mailto:karn@karchan.org">karn@karchan.org</A></I>) along with
the following particulars:<P>

<UL><LI>Your name (In full),
<LI>Your nickname on Karchan,
<LI>and The Location of your HomePage (Full URL if you please)
</UL>

Please put in the subject-line of the email <I>Karchan Webring</I>, so I
know what we are talking about here. Then I'll get back to you as soon as
possible, and tell you what Icon/HTML stuff you need to add to your HomePage in order to be
a member of the Karchan WebRing.<P>
