<H1>Help on Commands</H1>

A command takes place as soon as a player enters that specific command.
A command entered may consists of a regular expression. See for the regular
expression syntax <A
HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">here</A>.
<P>
Some examples:<P>
<B>quit</B><P>
Will only match the exact word (and exact lowercasing) quit. Nothing else
will do.<P>
<B>pounce (\w)+</B><P>
Will only match a two word sentence starting with the word pounce. (For
example : pounce karn, pounce bunnies, pounce everyone)<P>
<B>ask (to (\w)+ )?.+</B><P>
A difficult one. The sentence must begin with <I>ask</I>, than an
<I>to [word]</I> is possible but not mandatory and then an arbitrary number 
of keys.
<P>
It is also possible to make the command dedicated to a certain room. This
means that the command will not be available <I>outside</I> of a certain
room.

The command in question must always point to a method that contains the
scripting part responsible for executing the command. The scripting part comes
very specific. Pay special attention to the method name, as that is the
method the mud will search for in the database.<P>
Scripting always starts as the
following:
<PRE>&lt;object&gt;
&lt;function name="command" params="person,command"&gt;
</PRE>
The parameters in the scripting part above need some explaining:
<DL>
<DT>person
<DD>the person executing the command
<DT>command
<DD>an array containing the command. Every word is a specific element of the
array. For example:<P>
<B>say to Karn Hello</B><P>
Would provide the following:
<UL><LI>command[0]="say"
<LI>command[1]="to"
<LI>command[2]="Karn"
<LI>command[3]="Hello"
<LI>command.length=4
</UL>
</DL>

<H3>Adding a command</H3>

Adding a command is quite simple. Just fill out the name of the command and
the name of the method that 
you wish to call when that command is entered and press <I>Add Command</I>.
It is possible to have the same command multiple times, for instance in
different rooms.
A command is created using the defaults. The defaults are:
<UL><LI>a new id for the command
<LI>no room
<LI>default not callable (i.e. is not <I>active</I>)
</UL>  
Make sure that the method that this command is to call exists, or an error       
message will occur.<P>
<B>Note:</B> When entering a regular expression to match what any one person
will enter as a command, make certain that the regular expression is
appropriate. This includes but is not limited to : the same number of
closing parenthesis as opening parenthesis. Otherwise an exception will be
generated in the log, and perhaps people will not be able to play the game
any more.<P>
