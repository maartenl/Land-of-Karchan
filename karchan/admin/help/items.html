<H1>Help on Items</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
Items are split up into itemdefinitions and items. Every item has exactly
one item definition, but one item definition can be applied to multiple
items.<P>
And example would be the item definition of a bucket, but there could be 10
buckets in the game, all with the same item definition.
<H2>Containers</H2>
Some special items are <I>containers</I>, that can contain other items.
There are two ways of defining an itemcontainer:
<UL><LI>in the item itself
<LI>in the item definition (in which case all items that use this item
definition are containers)
</UL>

<H2>Container Definition</H2>

First of all, and this is important, the container field must be set to
<I>yes</I> or all other fields regarding containers are ignored.<P>
The other fields are capacity, isopenable and keyid. Capacity is used to
indicate how much a container can carry. Isopenable indicates whether the
open and close command will work. Keyid is the item definition identification
number of the item that can be used to unlock/lock the lock of the
container.
