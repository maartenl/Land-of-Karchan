<H1>Help on Boards</H1>
This functionality is used to display all available boards that are used for
discussions in the game.
<P>
Right now it is not possible to make any changes. If the need is there, I
will make it possible to add, delete or change boards.
<P><B>Note:</B> Bear in mind that the board called <I>logonmessage</I> is a
special case used to display logonmessages to users when entering the game.
This board should not be changed.
