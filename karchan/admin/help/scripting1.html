<H1>Help on Events</H1>

An event takes place at a certain date and time in the game. It can be a
repetitive event, taking place for example every hour. The way this is done
is by specifying at what time an event needs to take place. For example:

<P><B>minute:</B> 49<P>
If this event has this attribute, it will occur every hour at 11 minutes to
the hour.

<P><B>hour:</B> 9 <B>minute:</B> 49<P>
If this event has this attribute, it will occur every day at 11 minutes to
9 o'clock in the morning.<P>

There are three events possible:
<OL>
<LI>an event attached to person. i.e. you wish to make Bill do something at
a certain time
<LI>an event attached to a room. i.e. you wish to cause an avalanche in a
mountain pass every week, which must be cleared by players.
<LI>a global event. i.e. an event that is not attached to any person or
room, but generally runs anyway.
</OL>

The event in question must always point to a method that contains the
scripting part responsible for executing the event. The scripting part comes
very specific. Pay special attention to the method name, as that is the
method the mud will search for in the database.<P>
For the different cases scripting always starts as the
following:
<OL>
<LI><PRE>&lt;object&gt;
&lt;function name="event" params="person"&gt;
</PRE>
<LI><PRE>&lt;object&gt;
&lt;function name="event" params="room"&gt;
</PRE>
<LI><PRE>&lt;object&gt;
&lt;function name="event" params=""&gt;
</PRE>
</OL>
