<H1>Help on Methods</H1>

Methods in the database are quite simple and exist of a method name and the
method source. The method name is used to refer to by special commands and
events. The source is the tricky part.<P>

<H2>Objects, methods and fields</H2>
Here follows a summary of the diffent objects that are supported and the
methods and fields they contain:<P>

<H3>Adding a method</H3>

Adding a method is quite simple. Just fill out the name of the method that 
you wish to create in the form and press <I>Add Method</I>.
An empty method is created. Bear in mind that you will receive an error
message if the method name is already taken.

<H2>Links</H2>
The source is encapsulated within XML tags. XML tags are kind of like HTML
tags only more generic. Check <A
HREF="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp">here</A> for an
introduction. There is very little xml used in this mud, though. If you have
problems writing xml code, consider using an xml editor. I have not looked
around thoroughly, but there is a nice small java xml editor at <A
HREF="http://jsxe.sourceforge.net">http://jsxe.sourceforge.net</A>.<P>
One of the problems with XML is that HTML and XML do not mix well.
Therefore, if you want to display HTML tags in your script, please use
&amp;gt; for &gt; and &amp;lt; for &lt;. (Unless you are using an xml
editor.)<P>

If you wish to know more about the scripting language used, I suggest you
check out the <A HREF="http://www.simkin.co.uk/">Simkin homepage</A>. This
is essential if you wish to implement scripts.<P>

If you wish to know more about the % (percentage) keywords like %SNAME,
please check <A
HREF="/javadoc/mmud/characters/Person.html">here</A>. Look for
the three <I>writeMessage</I> commands.<P>

<H2>Errors</H2>
If there is an error in one of the scripts you wrote, the proper way to find
the error is to check out the <A HREF="../showlog.html">Logs</A> of the mmud. Every time a scripts is
executed but fails, the error is written in the log.
