You are presently in the room of lost souls. It is dark all around you, but
you see transparent souls everywhere. You are yourself a soul. A sign is
visible on the west-wall. You make an attempt to read it. After a while you
figure it out. This is what it says:<P>
Hello<P><I>
Let me introduce myself. I am Karn. You probably haven't heard of me, but I
am the diety of this place, and I am here to see that everything goes
according to the rules that I have made.<P>
You are just a spirit, a soul, a ghost, a what-ever-you-call-it. You have no
substance whatsoever. You can't go about playing with no body! So here you can mould and form your
own body, just the way <B>you</B> like it.  
<P>
There are certain rules which you have to abide by if you want to be able to
play without any problems:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>leave this game every time you play it with the commando <B>quit</B>. If you
don't, your session will continue without you.
<LI>do not start another session while you are still playing in one, that
will result in an error
<LI>read the book in the cave
<LI>do not go to another link while you are playing, this will make it
extremely hard to come back!
<LI>remember that this game is in the development stages yet, al lot of
things won't work, but this game will keep getting better
</UL>
That is about it. More detailed information can be found in the book
mentioned. If you have entered everything, please hit the <B>Leave</B>
button. Or hit <B>Clear</B> for a new try...<P>

Karn, Ruler of Karchan, Keeper of the Key to the Room of Lost Souls
