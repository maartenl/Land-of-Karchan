<H2>Introduction</H2>
This page contains most of the introductory information necessary for you to
get a similar Mud working like "Land of Karchan". I hope the information and
files you need are present here, if not, or if you want to see some
information added, gimme an email.<P>
I give this source code along with all the other files freely available
under the GNU Public Liscence (Also known as GPL, for more information do
visit <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</A>.) Why do I give
away the source code? Well, it's part of a new way of doing things. By keeping 
all source code private in the hands of companies you take away a
piece of knowledge of which a lot of people can benefit. Try looking at it
like instead of a company holding back the formula to the solution to a
disease, having the company give out the formula for public use, thereby
helping people all over the world. A lot of my source code is based upon
other people's source code, who basically did the same thing as me, thereby
creating a base on which I could build my mud.<P>

<FONT COLOR=red>The fact that I give away the source code
does not mean that you can go ahead and make an exact
duplicate of the Land of Karchan!!!</FONT><P>

I'm giving you the source code of my mud in order for you to make something
original with it. There is a clear distantiation between my mud
(<I>Maarten's MUD</I>) and the <I>Land of Karchan</I>. While <I>Maarten's
Mud</I> does fall under the GPL, <I>Land of Karchan</I> does no such thing
and is copyrighted by me and others.
<P>
Have fun experimenting, and do send me an email if something is not
clear.<P>

<H2>REQUIREMENTS</H2>

There are a lot of requirements that need to be satisfied before the mud can
be installed. If you are not really at home using UNIX like systems, and
Linux, and a command line interface along with databases, perhaps you should
reconsider downloading the source code to this mud.<P>

Here's a list:
<UL>
<LI>A computer (duh)
<LI>Linux (I personally use RedHat, but feel free to use any Distribution
you want as I only provide the source code which can be recompiled at will)
[<A HREF="http://www.linux.org">www.linux.org</A>]
<LI>gcc (Gnu C Compiler, usually already provided with Linux) [<A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org">www.gnu.org</A>]
