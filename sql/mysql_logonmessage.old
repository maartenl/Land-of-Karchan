elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

The process that takes care of the fighting and everything has been
temporarily disabled. Busy developing a new way of fighing.<P>

<B>Encumberance</B><P>
Encumberance. Who has not heard this word before.
Encumberance deals with how much you are carrying.
When you are carrying too much, you will
be unable to move. When you are carrying a lot you
will become weary and stumble over your own
feet.<P>
The amount that you are carrying will be available
using the \"stats\" command.<P>
For the record, money will also weigh a certain
amount. Gold coins are ofcourse heavier then Copper
coins, however, its value is also higher, so it
might be prudent to change all your copper coins for
gold ones. (like, 1 gold coin equals 100 copper coins
in value but not in weight)<P>

Don\'t say I didn\'t warn you!<P>

One more thing, the thing about the error you get when you are a newbie and
are attempting to move has been solved, as far as I can tell.<P>
