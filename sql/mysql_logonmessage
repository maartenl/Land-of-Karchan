elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

Seeing as important and possibly security sensitive information has
been removed from the source code and put into a nice config file, I
don\'t see why I cannot provide people (read) access
to the CVS Repository. The CVS Repository is the place where I work
(and the deps, when they feel like it) on the source code. As such it
always carries the latest and greatest changes. How this works can
be found at www.cvshome.org .
<P>
Here is the info for you to access my source code through CVS:
<UL>
<LI>username: anonymous
<LI>password: no password, just don't fill out anything
<LI>proper commandline: <I>cvs
-d :pserver:anonymous@www.karchan.org:/karchan/mud/cvsroot
&lt;command&gt;</I>
<LI>(You are ofcourse free to use another program to access
my sourcecode. I hear WinCVS and TurtleCVS are quite nice Windows GUIs)
</UL>
For example getting the latest documentation:<BR>
<I>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.karchan.org:/karchan/mud/cvsroot login<BR>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.karchan.org:/karchan/mud/cvsroot checkout docs<BR>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.karchan.org:/karchan/mud/cvsroot logout<BR>
</I>

Darnit, still not sleepy. Anyway, the latest addition to the mud is the
fact that no longer are important information hard coded. The mud runs now
by means of a configuration file. (Whooo! 22nd century technology!)<P>
That, and I decided to make the logonmessage a little smaller due to
increased demand.
