elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

The current deputies are: 
Kass, Kel, Silverblade, Blackfyre, Desdamona<P>

each year. I will try to log on on Monday to see what\'s up.<P>

Essent @ Home called me on Saturday. Apparently the cable guy is going
to come by on the 27th of February to fix my Cable internet.<P>
*sigh* It\'s about bleeding time.

Well, apparently I had to do some more stuff to get that thing fixed. It
should be fixed <I>permanently</I> now and healing and
encumberance and all the other stuff should work again.<P>
Regarding the items, apparently the items table was empty when I looked.
I had to put back a backup from the previous day. It did not seem to
be a database problem though.<P>
Regarding my Cable Internet. It seems I will really receive a phone
call one of these days. Here\'s to hopin\'.

Well, some people claimed that the stats did not improve
when you rest. I fixed it, I think. Sorry about that.<P>
I would also like to welcome a new deputy into this realm, Desdamona. Way
to go, Des!<P>
