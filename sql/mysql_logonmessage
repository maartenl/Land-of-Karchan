elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

All righty then.<P>

The Game now has a <FONT COLOR=\"red\">Land of Karchan -
Main Soundtrack</FONT>. The full mp3 version is available <A
HREF=\"/sound/mp3/Echoes_of_the_Past.mp3\">here</A>, but a small wav version
of the first thirty seconds is available <A
HREF=\"/sound/wav/echoes.wav\">here</A>. Ofcourse, the mp3 has much better
quality.<P>

Where did I get this? At my place of work I know a
person who calls himself <FONT COLOR=\"red\">Redheat</FONT>, who makes
Synthesizer music. He was kind enough to license two of his tracks to me for
free distribution on my karchan.org website. You can find his website at
<A HREF=\"http://www.red-heat.com\">http://www.red-heat.com</A>. He has
more scrumptious music to be downloaded there.<P>

Bear in mind that I have licensed his music so I am allowed to
distribute these two tracks through my website. If you wish to use these
sound tracks as well, you will have to contact him yourself.<P>

I hope you all like the music.<P>

In light of recent events, I would like to remind everyone to
read and abide by the Laws of Karchan. The Laws can be accessed by the
link on the main page. Any severe disobeyment of these laws can, and
probably will, result in a term of banishment that may
extend until the end of time.<br>Regards,<br>Kel, Deputy to Karn<br>
