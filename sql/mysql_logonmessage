elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

I don't know if any of you noticed but the game seems
to become less and less responsive when more and more
people are active. This is due to the fact that the
server is single-threaded. (i.e. it executes a command
sent by a user and then proceeds to the next)<P>

I have recently made the mud multi-threaded. Every
command to be executed is handled by a different
thread. So, several threads (i.e. commands) can be
handled in parallel which should increase the
responsiveness of the game wonderfully.<P>

However, this stuff is ofcourse still in beta so I
have to do some stuff with it to find out if all is
well.<P>
On a side note, I only got a cdrom and manual with my 
cable internet because the repair-guy is supposed
to bring all the necessary equipment I need with him.
I am just waiting for a phonecall so I can make
an appointment. Do you think he will call before
the end of the year?<P>
Anyway, to everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
<BR>Karn.

Got a package in the mail yesterday from Essent Cable Internet. I was
really happy.<P>
Opened it. Turned out to contain nothing but a <I>manual</I> for Karn\'s
sake! What do I want with a manual? I
need a cable modem and hardware, not a bloody manual.<P>
I am sad again.

All righty then.<P>

The Game now has a <FONT COLOR=\"red\">Land of Karchan -
Main Soundtrack</FONT>. The full mp3 version is available <A
HREF=\"/sound/mp3/Echoes_of_the_Past.mp3\">here</A>, but a small wav version
of the first thirty seconds is available <A
HREF=\"/sound/wav/echoes.wav\">here</A>. Ofcourse, the mp3 has much better
quality.<P>

Where did I get this? At my place of work I know a
person who calls himself <FONT COLOR=\"red\">Redheat</FONT>, who makes
Synthesizer music. He was kind enough to license two of his tracks to me for
free distribution on my karchan.org website. You can find his website at
<A HREF=\"http://www.red-heat.com\">http://www.red-heat.com</A>. He has
more scrumptious music to be downloaded there.<P>

Bear in mind that I have licensed his music so I am allowed to
distribute these two tracks through my website. If you wish to use these
sound tracks as well, you will have to contact him yourself.<P>

I hope you all like the music.<P>

In light of recent events, I would like to remind everyone to
read and abide by the Laws of Karchan. The Laws can be accessed by the
link on the main page. Any severe disobeyment of these laws can, and
probably will, result in a term of banishment that may
extend until the end of time.<br>Regards,<br>Kel, Deputy to Karn<br>
