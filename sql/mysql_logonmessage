elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

I am back from Croatia and I am still in one piece. It was a nice two weeks.
<P>
I am currently busy with a new implementation of the mud. This
implementation does not offer any specialties (yet) but is
more a release for me in order to make the mud
more conform client-server architecture instead of webscripting.
This new implementation seems to be working okay and seems to be stable.
<P>
The new implementation can be started at
<A HREF=\"http://www.karchan.org/karchan/enter_beta.html\">Beta Logon
Screen</A>. The new implementation will replace the old one at the end
of this week.<P>
Let us all pray that everything will go smoothly for once!<P>

The new implementation has just gone live. All in all you should not
notice any difference. If you do, or you notice that some commands are not
working, please send an email to 
<A HREF=\"mailto:deputy@karchan.org\">deputy@karchan.org</A> or 
<A HREF=\"mailto:karn@karchan.org\">karn@karchan.org</A>
so I can check it out.<P>
One of the little changes that you might have noticed is the extra
little piece of text at the top of your screen. It
contains the Version Number and last Compile Date/Time stamp
of the new mud engine. <P>

Kandy just told me that sending mudmail no longer works. She
is right and I\'ll work on it right away. Reading,
deleting and listing mudmail still works though.<P>
Furthermore Eok tells me that HTML tags do not work anymore. He is
right and I have to fix that, like, pronto, but tomorrow. I'm tired.
