elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

THe database was shot down by the operating system because it was taking
up too much memory. Ah, well, that happens
when any one program keeps running for approximately 200 days straight.<P>
Restarted and now we have plenty of free memory again.
