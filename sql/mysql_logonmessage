elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

There is the possibility to add your personal data to the website!
It is called a <I>Character Sheet</I>. Fill one in or check out the other 
people that already have one. You can find it <A

<FONT COLOR=blue><B>Oh, <I>BLUE</I> is back! Yes, people, blue is back on request of
lots of people. Ofcourse, it is only a matter of time before I decide to 
switch again. ;-)</B><P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=red>To those of you that do not know, the itemtable of the
database was corrupted. I fixed the problem, but I do not know how much
information was lost in the process. Will check and perhaps put back a
backup.<P>
On a related subject, I just changed the password authorization procedure.
You now have two passwords, the regular one that you use to log on, and a
<I>session password</I> that is only valid during the time that you play 
on the game and that is generated by the game itself when you log on.
<P>Advantage of this is that your <I>real</I> password will only be transmitted
once, namely during logon. After that, the game uses the Session Password.
