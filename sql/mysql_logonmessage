elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

Well, that was quite a scare, wasn\'t it? The server had crashed
approximately Tuesday, the 26th of March 2002. I
went and had a look. Apparently there were some
hardware problems, but after
some fiddling, dustblowing and shaking the little server seemed to
be functioning again.<P>
I did make use of the opportunity to install a new version
of the OS, and the thing seems to be stable. Let us hope it stays that
way, and that this hardware failure was just an accident. Otherwise
we might be in trouble.<P>
Suffice to say that I have not fixed everything yet, most
of the basic stuff should work, I think.<P>
Regards and have fun!<P>
