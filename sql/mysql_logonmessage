elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

Am about to go on holiday to visit my brother in Italy. When I get back
I plan on installing the new Java version of the mud, wether it is 
finished or not. Some functionality will be missing.
I will return during the weekend of the 15th of May.
Better hang on for a rough ride.
