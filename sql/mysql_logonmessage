elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

The current deputies are: 
Kass, Milady, Kel, Bladestorm, Blackfyre<P>

Rightyho. I will be off to Tenerife from December 3rd until the 11th, so you   
people know. I'll be sitting at the beach in the sun with a Pina Colada in
my hand, while all you people are shivering in the cold. Muhahaha!<P>     
Regards and have fun!<P>
