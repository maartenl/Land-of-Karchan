elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

Yes! And Welcome Back! The server was down for quite some time this time.
I did a complete reinstall seeing as the Filesystem was totally gone to hell
in a hand basket. The reason that it took so long, is that I am currently
busy moving to a new house. I had to move my ISDN with me as well, and
ofcourse the dudes from Telecom company screwed it up. 
Everything seems to be fixed now, regarding ISDN but the game will need some
additional tweaking.<P>
Regards and have fun once again!<P>
