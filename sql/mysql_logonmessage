elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

Well, I decided to clean the place up. The bantable has been reset so
everyone can join the game. However, it probably means that the bantable
will be filled again quite quick as well. I also did a cleanup of everyone
who has not been online for the past 90 days, that should clean the place a
little up.<p>I\'ll see about being a little more active regarding this place.

Well, I got the emailaccounts up and running again. 
(you know, <A HREF=\"mailto:deputy@karchan.org\">deputy@karchan.org</A>
 and all that stuff.) I cannot make any promises about answering emails
ofcourse.<P>Also added PHP support
to the Apache server. If this does not mean anything to you, well, let me
tell you it is damn cool stuff. I am redoing the whole cgi-script thingy in
php as it takes way too much time to maintain. Check out the who list on the
main page for an example.

Well, the initial problem was a little one. The disk partition was full.
After deleting some files I restarted the server and suddenly nothing
worked.
<P>
Well, I have no idea what is wrong, but after some god-awful hack I got
things working for now. I have to get this program redone in Java and rather
right now, before the whole thing comes crashing down. Anyone care to help?<P>
In how far would you people mind if I get a preliminary version done in Java
that works flawlessly, but most of the functionality will be gone? Or would
you rather have the current situation, a shitty server program that restarts
itself every 30 minutes but has items and whatnot.<P>
