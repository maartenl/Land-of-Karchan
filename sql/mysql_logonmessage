elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

The current deputies are: 
Kass, Milady, Kel, Bladestorm, Blackfyre<P>

Right! I got around to doing some programming. It has been a long time, but
I finally got myself to do something constructive. The Leather Shop in
Pendulis has a new item called 'brown leather common sack'. Why is this
important, you may ask yourself. Well, this item is a <I>container</I>.
Which means that it can contain other items. There are two new commands
available that may help you with containers, called '<I>put</I>' and
'<I>retrieve</I>'.<P>
This is all still highly <I>buggy</I>, so do report bugs if you find
them.<P>
I\'d also like to say \'Hi!\' to Blackfyre who has joined the ranks of
deputies.<P>
Regards and have fun!<P>
<I>Karn (Ruler of Karchan, Keeper of the Key to the Room of Lost
Souls)</I><P>
