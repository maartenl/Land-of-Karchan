elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

Some good news: I think I have most of the bugs that were causing freezes
and the white-screen-of-death. The game should be running more stable now.
*crosses fingers*
<P>
One of the little changes that you might have noticed is the extra
little piece of text at the top of your screen. It
contains the Version Number and last Compile Date/Time stamp
of the new mud engine. <P>
Sometimes the game will freeze up. This means that I screwed up and one of
the commands used is the cause. What happens is that I fix
it immediately and restart the game server. However, between the
game freezing up and me resetting the game the game is unavailable.<P>
