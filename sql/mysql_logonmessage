elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

The current deputies are: 
Kass, Kel, Silverblade, Blackfyre, Desdamona<P>

w00t! w00t! The Cable Guy came by last Thursday and installed everything
perfectly. I had to do some fiddlin\' but I got it working right away.<P>
All I have got to do now, is create the proper setup.<P>
You would not believe how fast the connection is! The Speed is making me
quite dizzy!! Some preliminary figures point to a download of 300 Kbytes/s.
<P>
I should be satisfied with my setup tomorrow evening, so I can devote some
more time to the mud!
