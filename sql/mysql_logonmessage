elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

The current deputies are:

Noticed that the game was acting wonky and been unable to reboot
it properly. Got an email from my database telling me a database table was
corrupt. Fixed it. Game should run stable now at least for a while.<P>
We do not seem to have lost any data though.

For the past two years I have yearned for a permanent Internet connection
at home, but been unable to get it at this backwater village
in nowhere-country.<P>
This summer, my cable company replaced most of the cable in the vicinity.<P>
Took a telephone yesterday and called to my local Cable company asking for
CableInternet Access. Turns out it will be available in December of this
year. Then I will have a dedicated 1-2 Mbit/s line. That day will be a day
of celebration and probably one of the best Christmas gifts ever.<P>
If they have the heart to postpone it (again) I will fall into a deep pit
of despair, plotting the demise of Cable TV Executives as I plummet down.

Dammit! It\'s 23:56 and still not sleepy.<P>
I have recently started a project at
<A href=\"http://sourceforge.net\">SourceForge</A>, in order to provide
better facilities to anyone wishing to contribute. You may find my specific
project (called MMud) both
<A HREF=\"http://mmud.sourceforge.net\">here</A> and 
<A HREF=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/mmud\">here</A>. One
of the facilities is for example to submit <I>bug reports</I>.<P>
Several people reported that <I>creating new characters</I> did not seem
to work. I checked it out, and they were right. It seems
that the mud had some problems dealing with <I>empty</I> fields. Fixed it.
Mail me if it happens again.<P>
I usually only accept requests for deputyship via my
official email address maarten_l@yahoo.com.<BR>
Current list of people interested in becoming <B>deputy</B>:

<LI>Krytt

Seeing as important and possibly security sensitive information has
been removed from the source code and put into a nice config file, I
don\'t see why I cannot provide people (read) access
to the CVS Repository. The CVS Repository is the place where I work
(and the deps, when they feel like it) on the source code. As such it
always carries the latest and greatest changes. How this works can
be found at www.cvshome.org .
<P>
Here is the info for you to access my source code through CVS:
<UL>
<LI>username: anonymous
<LI>password: no password, just don't fill out anything
<LI>proper commandline: <I>cvs
-d :pserver:anonymous@www.karchan.org:/karchan/mud/cvsroot
&lt;command&gt;</I>
<LI>(You are ofcourse free to use another program to access
my sourcecode. I hear WinCVS and TurtleCVS are quite nice Windows GUIs)
</UL>
For example getting the latest documentation:<BR>
<I>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.karchan.org:/karchan/mud/cvsroot login<BR>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.karchan.org:/karchan/mud/cvsroot checkout docs<BR>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.karchan.org:/karchan/mud/cvsroot logout<BR>
