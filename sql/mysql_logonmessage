elcome to the Land of Karchan MUD, a land filled with mystery 
and enchantment, where weapons, magic, intelligence, and common 
sense play key roles in the realm. Where love and war can be one 
and the same. Where elves coexist peacefully with the humans, and 
make war with the dwarves. Where the sun rises, and the moon falls. 
Where one can change into a hero with a single swipe of his 
sword.<P>

eputyship is one of the most sought after things on the mud as far as I can tell. People often come to me with the request that I make them a deputy. I often have to explain that the requirements are pretty steep. However!!! Right now, as of the beginning of the month, there are a number of <B>NEW</B> requirements!!! Anyone who wishes to become a deputy, besides all the other requirements, has to pay a fee of 35$ for the first month, and 20$ every month after that. Keep that in mind when you ask me.<P>

The fighting is back in working order, still needs a little work though.<P>
By the by, I am going away for approximately 11 days to a Popfestival in Danmark. Will try to see if I cannot log onto the game from there, but no promises, ofcourse.<P>
