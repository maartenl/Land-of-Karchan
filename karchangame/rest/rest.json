She was beautiful, consisting of a shallow mist with points of light spread throughout.</p>\\n\\n<p>She made one of the points the center of her being, what we nog call the sun or the Elves call <em>Kuri</em>. Next to this sun she created a world called Karchan, of <em>Land of Karchan</em> to be precise. She sent her two sons, Karn and Zhanos, to inhabit this world and shape it in the way as they wanted. The world was still rough and undefined, but with the powers provided by his mother Karn managed to create a nice land.</p>\\n\\n<p>Eventually the different races were created, and Karn noticed that having to govern an entire world so complex was getting more difficult every moment, so he created offspring to govern it for him. And the people inhabiting this world called them deputies.</p>\\n\\n<p>Every now and then he still makes improvements, but besides that his influence directly in this world is very limited.</p>\"}","overrideMimeType":false,"headers":[["Accept","application/json"],["Content-Type","application/json"]]}}
