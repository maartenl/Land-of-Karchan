The Test Database
=================

The test database is a copy of the production database and some things
require our attention.

First!
======

First you need to run all the database commands in the DATABASE file
below the --------.

Initialise test data
====================

The passwords need to be reset of the test accounts.

This can be done with the following sql statements.

update mm_usertable set password = sha1('secret') where name='Karn';
update mm_usertable set password = sha1('secret') where name='Hotblack';
update mm_usertable set password = sha1('secret') where name='Marvin';
update mm_usertable set password = sha1('secret') where name='Slartibartfast';
update mm_usertable 
set room = 1 
where name in ("Karn", "Hotblack","Marvin", "Slartibartfast");
update mm_commands set callable= 0 where command in ('w','west','go west');
update mm_commands set callable= 0 where command in ('n','north','go north');

// make sure we do not have any interference from the deputy commands
update mm_commands set callable = 0;

update mm_usertable set lok = 'QKgKtRAdaliTHwsR2EUxxoA78' where
name='Hotblack';
update mm_usertable set title = 'The Paranoid Android' where
name='Marvin';

// mail with id 24702 should not be deleted
update mm_mailtable set deleted = 0 where id = 24702;

Slartibartfast was created using the following settings:
{"name":"Slartibartfast",
  "title":"the Campaign for Real Time",
  "sex":"male",
  "password":"secret",
  "password2":"secret",
  "realname":"Unknown",
  "email":"slartibartfast@www.karchan.org",
  "race":"human",
  "age":"young",
  "height":"tall",
  "width":"very thin",
  "complexion":"swarthy",
  "eyes":"black-eyed",
  "face":"long-faced",
  "hair":"black-haired",
  "beard":"none",
  "arm":"none",
  "leg":"none"}

Triggers
=========

And lets not forget to add the insert trigger in there!
(sqlscripts/triggers/mm_usertable_insert_trigger.sql

Add Empty Table
===============

Also, seeing as the production database copy omits the mm_commandlog table,
we'll need to add it afterwards.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `mm_commandlog`;
CREATE TABLE `mm_commandlog` (
  id int(11) not null auto_increment primary key,
  `stamp` timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  `name` varchar(20) NOT NULL default '',
  `command` varchar(255) NOT NULL default ''
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
