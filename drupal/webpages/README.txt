The great thing about Drupal is that webpages can be dynamically changed.

However, this comes with it's own set of problems:
- the webpages are stored in a database, and cannot be easily changed
- the HTML of the webpages can be changed by Drupal or one of its editors
  without our consent, and it's hell to find out what we originally
  were typing. A good instance is the removal of onsubmit="function();return
  false;" by drupal.
- it bollocks up my indentation!
- it has no version control

So, in the interest of keeping a log *outside* of Drupal, here's the more
complex webpages that I feel require a little more.
