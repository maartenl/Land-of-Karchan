<p>I feel the following needs a little
explanation. Below you see a list of available Character Sheets. They
contain personal information like name, title, place of birth, and the story
line of characters, and references to other characters. In each case these
are put together by the people that originally created the character on the
game.</p>
<p>It provides valuable insights into the story behind this
Game.</p>
<p>Now you can add your piece of information as well. Just fill in
your name and password of the character you created on the mud, and you will
be presented with a form that you can fill out, and change later in the same
way.</p>
