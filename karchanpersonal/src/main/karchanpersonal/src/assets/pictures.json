When I view the website the navigation and buttons take up a ton of room and makes it hard to read. Would it be possible to make a mobile app for Karchan? Or somehow fix the navigation and button table on the web page so that it can be used again. My email is quixoticparody@gmail.com if you would like a tester, screen shots, or just a chit chat.</p>",
