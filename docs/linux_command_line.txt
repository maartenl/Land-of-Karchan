Pipes:
------

In order for some of the commands displayed above to be more powerfull and in order to make combination the pipe ("|") was invented.

cat audit.trail | grep 215.15 | grep 04-2000

for instance, will show you all lines in the audit trail that contain a number 215.15 (for instance in the IP) and contain 04-2000 (for instance in th date)

gunzip /karchan/secret_docs/audit.trail/2000/audit.trail.04.30.2000.gz

should also work and provide you with a nice file containing the audit trail of 04-30-2000.

cat audit.trail | less

will make it able for you to easily scvroll through the audit trail and even search

man less

provide the above command for more specifics upon the possibilties of the "less" command.

VI:
---

Currently, my favorite editor in which to edit stuff is called VI and can be started simply by typing in "vi" and pressing enter. Please, though, read up on how the vi editor works in some document/manpage or wahtever.

My advice is, get a good book on the basics of command shells. It helps.
