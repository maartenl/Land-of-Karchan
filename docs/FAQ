1. 

Question: Help! I cannot run the cgi-binaries because I get the message  

[src]$
./enter
./enter: error in loading shared libraries: libmysqlclient.so.8: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory

Answer: It is necessary for you to set your environment variable
"LD_LIBRARY_PATH" in order to be able for the program to find its shared
library. But, seeing as it is a webserver that needs to configure this, and
if you are running Apache, you need to put the following line into the
"httpd.conf":

SetEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib/mysql/

That should fix the problem.

Any comments, please tell me.
