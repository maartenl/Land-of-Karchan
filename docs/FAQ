Faq List:

This is a list of anwers to questions when you are stuck.

1. 

Question: Help! I cannot run the cgi-binaries because I get the message  

[src]$
./enter
./enter: error in loading shared libraries: libmysqlclient.so.8: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory

Answer: It is necessary for you to set your environment variable
"LD_LIBRARY_PATH" in order to be able for the program to find its shared
library. But, seeing as it is a webserver that needs to configure this, and
if you are running Apache, you need to put the following line into the
"httpd.conf":

SetEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib/mysql/

That should fix the problem.

2.

Question: Help! My PHPScripts or the server is generating unwanted \
(backslashes) in front of \ (backslashes) and ' (quotes) and " (double
quotes).

Anwer: this is possible due to a wrong setting in your php module in the
apache server. Check out the script configuration.php, look for the php
configuration variable <I>magic_quotes_gpc</I>. It should be turned OFF.

If it is set to on, as was the default in old installations of Linux, you
can turn it back off in the php.ini file (which is probably located in
/etc/).

That should fix it.

Any comments, please tell me.
