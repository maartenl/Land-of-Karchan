Combat-BUG!!!!

Important:

Make it so that disabling or enabling your pkill during combat is
impossible!!!

Combat:

Input: attacker victim action
Output: actionefficiency (1..10) 

Isabo is always trying to steal my keys. Gotta make a story about that if
possible.

Can you add spots to wear things, like 'around waist' so we can have belts?
and 'over shoulder' for packs? Then when the
wieght system is in, people will be able to use these things to carry their
stuff

weight.

weight = copper*1 + silver*2 + gold*3 +
	(item1.weight*item1.amount + item2.weight*item2.amount + ...)

- give
- get

- search


Blackfyre tells you : Okie doke, good stuff. Those two things there can make
for a few basic quests in themselves.
Blackfyre tells you : It would be useful of bots could drop something when
you kill them, you know. Like an item that could be placed in them in the
refresh thing that falls
out when they're killed, or like a few silver or such. A way to make money
or gain items, you know. Something that could be elaborated on later, so if
you kill a buck you
could take it to a shop and have something made, so on
Blackfyre tells you : Just extra ideas I thought I'd toss at you. A really
important one would be a way to affix an item to a character so they don't
lose it even if they die.
One that only a deputy could change the owner of. In a table, of course, for
ease of use. But the items would be like Ring of the Archmagii, which would
go to the Archmage
of the MIF, and allow them to add and delete people from the MIF's list, and
other powers that only the Archmage should have. If it were an item it would
add to roleplay,
and make it so it's just a simple sql to change the item, as well as people
that lead a guild should have the most in ways of spells and so on, which if
programmed to be part
and parcel of an item such as that, would be easier then programming it into
the spells part. Or, I think so in any case
Blackfyre tells you : Er, that was a bit overboard, but the idea is, could
there be a itemtable that we could create items in that would stick to the
owner. A seprate table,
and perhaps the items would show up as a "She is wearing a Ring of the
Archmagii on her righthand" instead of "She is wearing a Archmagii, magic
ring on her right hand",
or such. You know what I mean, a small grammar change for magical items.
Blackfyre tells you : In like a magicitems table. It could also be
elaborated on later, so items with effects that need to be programmed in are
on a seperate table from the
normal items table
nikkoju appears.
nikkoju leaves west.
Blackfyre tells you : Anyhow, just being able to afix an item permanently to
a person and only that person with no duplicates of the item is much needed,
forgetting the
rest of it.
Blackfyre tells you : Must go. You can always tell when I'm going, big trail
of tell spams of opnions beforehand :)

In that case, instead of them being like one goblin and showing up in
seperate rooms like items do, they could be bots 1-10 on the list, so each
could
be different if wanted, or not.
Blackfyre tells you : So like goblin #201 in room 3, #202 in room 7, and
#203 in room 255
Blackfyre tells you : It's only really useful for killable bots that fall
under 3 in the god field, the green ones, since the blue bots are non-player
characters that shouldn't be
killed (NPCs)
Blackfyre tells you : Oh, and are you going to be putting that feature back
on the greenbots again that makes it so they appear as "A soft, cuddly
rabbit is here..." instead of
"rabbit is here..."
Blackfyre tells you : Adio

It is my sad duty that I do this... Here Is a Prayer for Lord~Rahl, he has
died last night during an assault : THE WARRIORS PRAYER With heads hung low
and swords by
our side we say fairwell...god speed and speak: Gods of war I call you. My
Sword is by my Side. I Seek a Life of Honor, Free from all False Pride. I
will Crack the Whip with
a Bold Mighty Hail. Cover me with Death if I Should Ever Fail. Glory,
Majesty, Unity Hail, Hail, Hail: then raising our swords we hail you for the
last time. He was a Great
Leader and Person may he rest with the souls of the Victorious.

Library => BookKeeper / Keeper of Books

Okay. I was going to see what I could find out on the classes that AA has.
Might give us some ideas on what to do for the guilds. Like, for
instance...the MIF would have fireball spells, the Knights would be like
Paladins with perhaps a smite-like spell, the Rangers would have
hunting-like things, Clerics would
call on the gods to heal and such, Druids would do nature healing-types. The
Death Seekers are tough...maybe they'd be like necromancers. If you don't
know what that is,
it is a nasty death mage.

"Song of the Necromancer" by Clark Ashton Smith 

I will repeat a subtle rune--
And thronging suns of Otherwhere
Shall blaze upon the blinded air,
And spectres terrible and fair
Shall wake the riven world at noon.

The star that was mine empery
In dust upon unwinnowed skies:
But primal dreams have made me wise,
And soon the shattered years shall rise
To my remembered sorcery.

To mantic mutterings, brief and low,
My palaces shall lift amain,
My bowers bloom; I will regain
The lips whereon my lips have lain
In rose-red twilights long ago.

Before my murmured exorcism
The world, a wispy wraith, shall flee:
A stranger earth, a weirder sea,
People with shapes of Fäery,
Shall swell upon the waste abysm.

The pantheons of darkened stars
Shall file athwart the crocus dawn;
Goddess and Gorgon, Lar and faun,
Shall tread the amaranthine lawn,
And giants fight their thunderous wars.

Like graven mountains of basalt,
Dark idols of my demons there
Shall tower through bright zones of air,
Fronting the sun with level stare;
And hell shall pave my deepest vault.

Phantom and fiend and sorceror
Shall serve me...till my term shall pass,
And I become no more, alas, 
Than a frail shadow on the glass
Before some latter conjurer.


From "Selected Poems" by Clark Ashton Smith, 1971: Arkham House Publishers. 

This is not the path I thought. This is not the place I sought. This is not
the dream I bought. Just a fever of fate I've caught. I'll change highways
in a while. At the crossroads,
one more mile. My path is lit by my own fire. I'm going only where I desire.
On the road that I have taken. One day, walking, I awaken. One day, walking,
I awaken. On the
road that I have taken.


On the road that I taken. 
One day, walking, I awaken. 
Amazed to see where I have come. 
Where I'm going, 
where I'm from.

Wuver :
The tip of the tail is a thick knot of cartelage from which a 2-foot-long
stinger portrudes, very much like that of a scorpion."
Mielikki says [to ryoko] : Hm, that would've been interesting. I could've
really given Corgan a scare then! "A wyvern is a distant cousin to the
dragon. It is a huge flying lizard with a poisonous stinger in its tail."The
35-foot-long dark brown body of the Wyvern is half tail. Its leathery
batlike wings are over 50 feet from tip to tip..."The head alone is 4 feet
long and filled with long, sharp teeth. Unlike the dragon, it has only hind
legs, using them the same way a hunting bird
would."The eyes are red or orange. The beast makes two sounds: a loud hiss,
which sounds like a hot sword plunged into water, and a low, deep-throated
growl, much like that of a bull crocodile...""If the wyvern hits you with
his tail, then you can be poisoned. You will lose a certain number of health
points every minute or so until the poison is
removed.""One of the potions you made can serve to cure the poison. Karcas
or someone else can sell them."


Mielikki says [to mordygan] : Although your brothers are giving me a hard
time about it. Furch says he will polymorph as he pleases but is an elf
right now. manatoba is
flat-out refusing to be a diety. We'll have to write it in the Chronicles
that he appears in human form. (-; Oh, and think about what you want to be a
diety OF....
mordygan says [to mielikki] : Did I tell you I died twice the other day on
AA?
still in Milady's mudmail. Grrr....I think Furchin is the god of the land,
Meadel will remain in the
Chronicles as the god of the sea (he is no longer a deputy though), manatoba
is the god of Guardianship and is our Protector ( I think), Ryoko is the
goddess of love, and I am
the goddess of nature (Mistress of the Forest). Not sure what is left.
Mielikki says [to you] : Actually, manatoba had a good idea to explain
Meadel...and it would probably please Meadel too. Let's make him the god of
music, the silver bard
of Karchan. "If you listen closely at times, you can still hear the notes
from his mystical lyre." (-;
the god of the sky, god of
elementals, god of the sea might still be available if we make Meadel the
god of music.....we need to keep it in theme with Karchan, silly!
Mielikki says [to mordygan] : Well, if we make Meadel the god of music,
would you like to be the god of the oceans?
Mielikki says [to mordygan] : It's not a big hurry....Ryoko is sort of
working on re-writing the Chronicles. Oh-oh...I need to get going!
mordygan says [to mielikki] : We'll see. I'm not much of a water person....
Mielikki says [to mordygan] : I know...you can be the god of dancing and
laughter! Maybe that would fit in...(-;

Those who would banish the sin of greed embrace the sin of envy as their
creed. Those who seek to banish the sin of envy as well, only draw elaborate
maps of hell.

Karn has entered the game...
You appear from nowhere.
You go to sleep.
Zahnos has entered the game, again...
Zahnos has entered the game...
SLIVER has entered the game...
Blackfyre tells you : Hello!
You wake up.
SLIVER has entered the game...
You tell to blackfyre : Howdie.
You tell to blackfyre : How are things working out with the night and day
thingy.
Blackfyre tells you : I am supposed to talk to you about the Ranger's Guild
building.
SLIVER tells you : WILL YOU TAKE ME TO THE ROAD I'M SORT OF LOST IN PENDULIS
Blackfyre tells you : A lot of people were complaining, but they just stay
in the light now. :)
You tell to blackfyre : I thought so, had some complaints yesterday from
Gorath. I'll try to get the bloody
kerolamp working before I leave.
SLIVER tells you : THANKS TO YOU MY FRIEND
Blackfyre tells you : That's good, most people have no use for items since
none seem to do anything. 
It is morning, the first rays of the sun emerge from the horizon as the sun
begins again in his toilsome journey
through the heavens...
You notice that the wall in the north disappears, Blackfyre appears, and the
wall replaces itself.
Blackfyre bows gracefully to you.
Blackfyre greets you.
You bow gracefully to blackfyre.
Blackfyre says [to you] : Hello. :)
Blackfyre clears..
You say : Hi.
Blackfyre says : Done.
Blackfyre says [to you] : What will you do today?
You say [to blackfyre] : Do you think I should have one hour of darkness,
then one hour of light, or is this ok?
Blackfyre says [to you] : If you fix the lamps then I think and hour each is
good. :0
Blackfyre says : It seems days go by awful fast in Karchan. ;)
You say [to blackfyre] : I thought so too.
Link has entered the game...
Blackfyre says [to you] : We found your teleporter just north of here, is
ther another?
You ask blackfyre : Teleporter?
Blackfyre thinks.
You notice that the wall in the north disappears, Link appears, and the wall
replaces itself.
Link bows gracefully.
Blackfyre says [to you] : A couple screen north it lets you choose to go up,
if you do then you appear in the
cave, Room number 1 I think it is.
Link says [to blackfyre] : is he goign to add to the ranger's place tonight
Blackfyre bows gracefully to link.
Blackfyre says [to link] : Didn't ask him yet. He's busy. :)
Link asks you : has blackfyre told you about where we chose to stay]
You say : I have to go, be back in half an hnour or so.
Link says : hmm.... ok then...
You say [to link] : He didn't tell me anything.
Blackfyre waves to you.
Karn looks questioninglingy at Blackfyre.
Link waves to you.
Blackfyre says [to link] : We can think on it a little more now. :0
Link says [to you] : yeah i know now
Blackfyre says [to you] : I was waiting until you didn't seem as busy. :)
You say [to link] : You have descriptions ready? And where do you want it?
Link says : i will be right back okay
You notice Link waving his hand in front of the north-wall. At first you
wonder what Link is waving at, then
suddenly the entire wall disappears! Link leaves to the north and behind him
the wall immediately appears again
as before.
SLIVER has entered the game...
Blackfyre says [to you] : We want it to be in the waterfall. We'd like to
have a nature call instead of a magic
wave to get in.
Blackfyre says [to you] : We were talking something like this:
Blackfyre steps up to the waterfall and makes a sound like a bird. You
wonder what he is doing when the
waterfall suddenly splits open and he steps through. The waterfall closes
behind him.
You say [to blackfyre] : Good choice!!! Behind the waterfall.
You ask blackfyre : I didn't know you were a ranger, I thought you were a
MIF-member.,
Link tells you : umm....well.....Its going to be behind the snake river
water fall....ask blackfyre for the description
You say [to blackfyre] : Sounds like fun. Gimme some descriptions.,
Blackfyre says [to you] : First we were thinking of it being in an old tree,
but that would have to be some tree.
:)
Blackfyre says [to you] : I'm the Dark and Deadly Black Ranger of Karchan.
:)
You say [to blackfyre] : Indeed. I think it is a wonderful idea. Very
original. Much nicer then a tree (we already
have a treehut somewhere)
Link has entered the game, again...
SLIVER has entered the game, again...
Link has entered the game, again...
Karn shudders.
Blackfyre says [to you] : 
Behind the Falls
[north]
You are standing in the damp cave behind the waterfall. A small amount of
light filters in through the water, but
you can not see much by it. There is a strong, wooden door heading further
into the cave.
You notice that the wall in the north disappears, Link appears, and the wall
replaces itself.
Blackfyre says [to you] : That's just a rough idea. He hasn't told me
anything much. :)
Blackfyre says [to link] : How about this? 
Behind the Falls
[north]
You are standing in the damp cave behind the waterfall. A small amount of
light filters in through the water, but
you can not see much by it. There is a strong, wooden door heading further
into the cave.
Link says [to blackfyre] : what was the description 
Blackfyre says [to link] : Good? No?
Blackfyre clears...
Blackfyre says : Done.
Blackfyre says [to link] : Well?
Link says [to blackfyre] : Its good, i like it
Blackfyre says [to link] : Thanks. What about that "Blackfyre steps up the
the waterfall and makes a sound like

Slowly the sun sinks below the horizon, twilight enters and within no time,
all will be dark...
Blackfyre may have to leave at any time...
You say : Indeed not much. Do you have any more descriptions? Then I can
begin implementing them./
You say : Man, nice dragon.
Blackfyre has entered the game, again...
Link says : thats when the command Nature Call comes in,"Ranger's name"walks
into the
calm,Crystal-clear,water, and steps up to the waterfall. "ranger's name"
then makes the sound of a bird and the
water slowy parts and "ranger's name" passes through the solid stone wall
without a trace.
Blackfyre says [to link] : Do you have more?
Link says : i had to clear so if you said anything after the dragon tell me
again
Blackfyre says [to link] : Solid stone wall?
Blackfyre says [to you] : I can think some stuff up real quickly before I go
if you want.
You go to sleep.
Blackfyre says : No more Kedron clones. :)
Blackfyre thinks.
Blackfyre says [to link] : Hello?
Blackfyre says : I will think of some things then.
Blackfyre says [to you] : 

The Main Room


Blackfyre says : That's it, now the description...
Link says : 

Gathering Place Of Ranger's



After fighting you way through the damp,dark,and creepy tunnel, you find
yourself standing in the Ranger's
Gathering Place. To the east leads to the hall where the ranger's have their
rooms. To the west is the vault
where all the items,weapons,and money can be kept with saftey.To your right
you can see writing carved on the
stone walls, and to your left appears to be a place where you can carve
messages on the wall to leave for fellow
members.

[East] [West]

i hope i did not mess it up 
Link says : i was here i was typing now for what it says on teh right wall.
Blackfyre says : I have to go now, see you all tomorrow.
Blackfyre bows gracefully to you.
Blackfyre bows gracefully to link.
Blackfyre says [to link] : I think Karn is eating or something. You'll have
some time to think. I suggest "In
various palces around the room you can see wooden carvings of animals, all
finely crafted by the hand of a
Ranger."
Link says : by typing look at carvings this is what will appear.

Carvings



These are the commands that will be used by the Ranger's. 
1.Nature Call-lets you enter and exit the Waterfall
2.Nature Chat-lets you chat with all ranger's logged on.
3.Nature List-lists all current ranger's.
4.Nature Addmember-adds member to the rangers w/leader's permission.
5.Nature Deletemember-Deletes member from the ranger's.

Blackfyre says : See you later if you are here.
Blackfyre waves to you.
Blackfyre waves to link.
Blackfyre left the game...
Link says [to you] : well i hope you got all this cuz I am going to husk for
a while.
Link goes to sleep.
You wake up.
SLIVER has entered the game...
It is morning, the first rays of the sun emerge from the horizon as the sun
begins again in his toilsome journey
through the heavens...

-----------------------------------------------------------------


Implement Fishing!!!

we can play it now, it involves a small character and alot of running from
others, scenario: an orc by the name of psycho has
just killed a faerie or two, for some unknown reason he is immune to magic,
making it impossible for you to deal with him directly, so the people
running about have to find him and slay him, the catch his wimpy is set
fairly high, what you can do, you can beam each participant to
psycho's location once, and you can do all mud tells as to his location
every few minutes as you feel like, BTW I will be psycho, running about
the mud,

 i have some to report you: 1) whimpy doesn't work, 2) i'm terribly hungry
quite all time i will be
very fat if i eat so much ;) 3) when i eat gingerbread i receive "you eat
apple tart" ?? 4) crossection in large forest near
castle is turned ab. 180 degrees 5) now i must go home so answer me by mail
if you want. LONG LIVE KARCHAN (&
it's ruler:)

Ideas for spells on Zahnos:
Vampyric touch => healing door het bijten van mensen
Gingerbread man => man hakken in gingerbread, andere mensen moeten hem
opeten, dan wordthij weer beter.
summon monster
create monster
regenerate monster
elen tells you : The reason why Zhanos is now Zahnos is because the essance
of zhanos was sumoned by an evil
wizard. The wizard had little control over zhanos so he possed him. The
wizard then renamed himself zahnos and has
all his abilities and memories. Even though he doesn't relize it he'sa being
controlled by zhanos:)
if he no attack => then ander speler hem niet kan attack.

Traders Guild - Guild where traders go to hoard money!!!!
			Tarath + firex (bro:)
Territory off Karchan
town + cave = neutral ground
pendulis = knights + Mif
standing stones = Mystic Maidens
Legion of Chaos + woods = for villains

Power to guildleaders:
manatoba = knights
furchin = MIF
Ryoko = maidens
meadel = gaurdian of newbies
zhanos = Leader of Chaos

Guards to prevent people from entering forbidden guilds.

Future Guilds to be:
Sky legion Guild
	 I have formed the Sky legion Guild with Falconius Sky Keeper. It will have
	three levels The recruites, Initiates (like sqires) And the Holy order of
	the Sky Knights. We have
	posted it in the Public boards. I have a couple of questions... Can we have
	a base of operations,
	Could one of us become one of the 2 needed knights and can you use the pick
	to fight? 
The House Of Bishop
The Justice & Revenge guild
the Magi of the Inner Flame
	ATTENTION ALL MAGES!!!A new guild is forming just for you. Due to many
	different
	questionings about a guild for enchanters, I am interested in starting up
	one called the
	Order of the Inner Flame. I have mage experience from other MUDs similar to
	this one,
	and have held high guild positions b4 on other games. Mail me for info.
	 the Magi of the Inner Flame.
	Vulcan, Telken
Order of the Eboney Shield
	Two paths, one of the warrior, one of the faith, which is supportive
	of the Church of Karchan.
Mystic Maidens of Karchan
	ladies' group parallel with Knights of Karchan en they wanna cast
	spells	


a psionicist guild. Where all those who felt mentally inclined could learn the powers
*wink* of the mind.
Zental tells you : The powers I was planning would go in this order:
Clairsentience (the power to
see the world from where you are by power of the mind). This could be used
in a command such as
where, which would be like "who" only it would also tell where the person
was.
Zental tells you : a psionicist uses his\her mind to see and change the
physical, mental, and spiritual
world.
Zental tells you : The second power I was planning would be psychoportation
(Moving by the
power of the mind). This could be used in conjuncture with a "Go to
(somewhere)" comand.
Zental tells you : The third power I'd like initiates to gain would be
psychometabolism (The power
of mind over body). The comand would be "Heal (someone)" And would restore
the targeted
person to full health.
Zental tells you : The fourth power, that of telepathy (Mind to mind
contact) Could be used with a
"Listen to (someone)" command allowing the psionicist to hear all tell to
and whisper to messages
Zental tells you : May as well finish off the list, the final power I was
hoping for would be
psychokinesis (Controlling the physical world with the mind). It would be
usefull when badguys
come in, and the comand would be "Detonate (someone)" It would cause the
same amount of
damage as three brutal crushings and would only work on badguys.

Guild of Peace and Honor
	 The name of the Guild is The Guild of Peace and Honor. Our purpose is to
	uphold the
	Rightousness of the Realm and to Assist any Knight in doing so. Also we are
	friends to all and will be a low key
	guild with only few members. We will seek out the members guilds and seek
	peace between all. Also the
	memberts will be hand picked by me and will consist of those who are
	peaceful at heart.

Here is what we have so far.  We don't expect them all, since some might
disrupt the game.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Ranger name) places one of his hands on (person) and says a prayer to
the spirits of the forest.  A greenish-brown aura begins to surround
(person) and they suddenly feel revitalized as their lost energies are
restored.
bless (person)
A member can heal someone of two points of health per level of the
Ranger casting the spell. (limit is level 10)

(Ranger name) sprinkles some water from a golden vial over the earth and
quickly green vines grow from the ground, wrapping all around (person).
Screen says to person.  You cannot move now.  To escape this type break
vine until you have broken all of your binds.
entangle (person)
This summons vines to grow from the ground and it tangles around the
victim and holds them. Two vines per level of ranger.  To get loose type
break vine They cannot move until the vines are all broke.

(Ranger name) speaks a word of the moon spirit and suddenly a bright
beam of moonlight shines down from the sky and lights up the room,
chasing away the darkness of Kuri.
moonbeam
This summons a bright beam of moonlight that lights up a dark
room.  It only lasts while you are in the room.

(Ranger name) calls out to the spirits of the wind and raises his arms
to the sky.  A slight breeze begins to blow, then picks up in force
until all you can hear is the howling of the wind as it sweeps through
the room.
summon wind
Brings a deafening wind that makes it so no one in the room can talk
without using the shout command.
(Ranger name) calls to the spirits of nature, asking them for food and
drink.  A bright flash of sunlight temporarily blinds you, but when it
is gone there is a biscuit and a glass of water lying on the earth in
front of you.
create food & water
This creates a dry biscuit and a glass of water or some other drink. One
per level of caster to a limit of 5.

(Ranger name) pulls a small golden flute from his pocket and plays a
tune. A graceful falcon flies from the forest and lands on one the
Ranger's shoulder. He gives the bird something, and it flies away.
The people near the recipient will see:  A small bird flies from the sky
and lands on (Ranger name)'s shoulder. It drops something into their
hand and then flies off into the forest.
play flute (item) (person)
This allows a Ranger to give an item to another active Ranger from
anywhere within the MUD. A small bird appears and takes the item to the
other ranger.

(Ranger name) clenches his hand into a fist, and a greenish-brown aura
surrounds it.  To your utter amazement his fist changes entirely into
stone before your very eyes.
stonefist
This adds +1 damage per level of caster (up to 10) when they attack
something without a weapon.

(Ranger name) places a hand on (person)'s arm and says a word of ancient
nature.  Sticky green sap appears on (person)'s arm and begins to bubble
as it burns their skin.
poison sap (person)
This takes one damage per level of caster away from the named creature.
Limit is level 10

(Ranger name) closes his eyes raises his arms to the sky.  Dark clouds
appear in the sky, driven by howling winds.   Soon the clouds are
completely covering the sky and darkness like that of Kuri has set in.
summon darkness
Causes night in whatever room the Ranger is in, until they leave.

(Ranger name) raises his arms into the air and as he does so he is
surrounded by a green-brown light.  Suddenly, almost like a wave, his
skin changes into that of the bark of a tree.
barkskin
Makes the Ranger tougher, so that opponents do -1 damage per level of
the ranger (up to level 10).

(Ranger name) crosses his arms and a greenish-brown aura surrounds him.
As you watch, his entire body, changes into stone.
stoneskin
Makes the Ranger tougher, so that opponents do -2 damage per level of
the ranger (up to level 15).

(Ranger name) raises his arms into the air and drops a handful of rose
petals onto the ground.  Beautiful red roses appear from the earth
around the room and writhe around as they quickly grow, tangling around
each other as they do.  Soon all exits are blocked by the wall of
thorns.
wall of thorns
This makes a wall of thorns appear around a room, blocking movement in
any direction unless they type hack east/west/north/south and so on. Two
hacks worth of wall per level of caster.
If someone attempts to move east it says; You attempt to go east, but
the wall of sharp thorns hinder your passing.  You must hack east to
leave.  And if someone was hacking it would say: You notice Blackfyre
hacking at the thorns in the east.

(Ranger name) says a word of ancient nature and suddenly begins to fade
from sight.  He walks over to a nearby tree, enters it, and vanishes.
transport via plant
This allows a ranger to enter the teleport by plants only to a room with
plants to exit out of, for instance, from the hut to the waterfall...

(Ranger name) says a prayer to the spirits of the animals, and a
greenish-brown aura appears around him.  Slowly his entire form begins
to change until a (description of animal) (animal) is here...
polymorph to "(description of animal)" (animal)
This will allow a ranger to actually morph into an animal from the
game.  No special things are added because of this, except maybe when on
a screen it says: A (description of animal) (animal) named (ranger name)
is here...
For example: A fearless and barbaric, Huge Black Bear named Link is
here...

(Ranger name) frowns at (person) and says a word to the wolf spirits.
Before your eyes he begins to stand with a curve in his back as he
changes form, until a wolf is standing here.  He now has the curse of a
the were-wolf!
lycanthropy curse (person)
This brings the curse of lycanthropy upon a character, changing them
into a wolf.  The wolf cannot attack or talk, just walk and howl.  To
undo this howl once per ranger level.

Westril smiles to you.<BR>
<B>Westril says [to you]</B> : Well, what would you like to do? <BR>
<B>You say [to westril]</B> : I've got my eye on the classroom where I need to be... sometime soon.<BR>
<B>Westril says [to you]</B> : Ok.<BR>
The sad remains of chipmunk turn to dust.<BR>
Westril glances at Karn's face....*giggle*...She reaches forward and plucks off the red nose Rodian Stuck on earlier...<BR>
torko has entered the game...<BR>
<B>Westril asks you </B>: What class do you have?<BR>

Person not found.<BR>
<B>Westril tells you</B> : Hhhmmm...sounds important. <BR>
<B>You tell to westril</B> : Well, it isn't.<BR>
<B>Westril tells you</B> : *chuckle* <BR>
<B>You tell to westril</B> : We sit around, and talk about how this final examination thingy is going to go, etc. It's only two study points, and it's only 4 days, so ther.<BR>
<B>You tell to westril</B> : Got to continue with it!!!<BR>
You go to sleep.<BR>
<B>Westril tells you</B> : Ok.<BR>
<B>Elwood tells you</B> : Zahnos needs a leash... I mean interrupting an MIF spell duel and frogging all MIF members was rude...<BR>
Westril appears.<BR>
Westril leaves north.<BR>
<B>Westril tells you</B> : Well, Here I go again...bugging you with more questions...I've nothing else to do at the moment and...well, you're the only victim on at this time...hehe. Ok. Question #1: Sports. Do you...like/hate sport?...Watch it?...Play it? If so...which sports?? (=<BR>
dragoon has entered the game...<BR>
<B>Westril tells you</B> : Yesterday you asked me what I wanted to do when I graduated....(more like if *sigh*)...anyway...simple question....what are your ambitions once you graduate?<BR>
besa has entered the game and is new here...<BR>
<B>Westril tells you</B> : Question #3: Here's one not mant people like...are you still living at home with your parents? ACK!! *joking* Or flatting?? Most of my friends...what am I talking about...all of them are still with their parents...mind you most of them are slighty younger than me...and having free accomodation, cooked meals and laundry washed for oneself would be a big temptation to stay. Even so you'd think by the age of twenty at least they might like to get out on their own. Hhhmmm...come to think of it I didn't have a choice...oh well. *smile*<BR>
Elwood has entered the game...<BR>
<B>Westril tells you</B> : #4: Favourite colour? <BR>
<B>dragoon tells you</B> : KARN! Why did my inventory empty out for no reason? WHAT THE HELL(OW) HAPPENED?<BR>
Elwood has entered the game...<BR>
Furchin has entered the game...<BR>
<B>Westril tells you</B> : #5 Music: What do you like? hate? Do you play a musical instrument? Or sing?...hey you never know *chuckle*<BR>
<B>Westril tells you</B> : You don't have to answer these...well not if you don't want to *smile*. Just something to do...which is sad really...oh well.<BR>
<B>Furchin tells you</B> : Can you do me a really big favor? Add a "old, silver sword" to the game as a wieldable item. It can (and should) be completely worthless, and you can get rid of it when real swords are added. But we need this sword to roleplay the killing of zahnos.<BR>
Furchin appears in a cloud of smoke.<BR>
<B>Furchin says [to you]</B> : The sword shouldn't reappear anywhere like the other items, just one copy will work.<BR>
Karn has entered the game, again...<BR>
You appear from nowhere.<BR>
You greet furchin.<BR>
<B>Furchin says [to you]</B> : Oh, sorry, hello :)<BR>
<B>You tell to westril</B> : I used to Volleyball, when I was young (say one year ago)<BR>
<B>You tell to westril</B> : Ilik tennis, i always watch the Frnch Opn<BR>
<B>Westril tells you</B> : Volleyball Rocks!!  Will hopefully be playing Intercollege Volleyball next semester!! Love it.<BR>
<B>Furchin asks you </B>: Will you do it?<BR>
<B>Westril tells you</B> : Are you telling me that 22 is young?! Tell that to my friends *sigh*<BR>
<B>Furchin says [to you]</B> : The idea is to hide the sword in an a well hidden and out of the way area, and make everyone search for it. There could be clues to its location from "the book of the future" and "the book of the past"; I'd write these either on public or into new areas myself so you don't need to do anything.<BR>
Furchin goes to sleep.<BR>
<B>Westril tells you</B> : Is ther a legal drinking age over in the Netherlands??<BR>
Furchin wakes up. Furchin is now wide awake.<BR>

Mielikki has entered the game...<BR>
<B>Mielikki tells you</B> : Hello, Daddy!<BR>
<B>Mielikki tells you</B> : Furchin told me his idea, and I agree.  A simple silver sword that is actually useless would be nifty to roleplay fighting Zahnos!  He finally made everyone mad enough at him that the forces of good are stirring against the forces of evil!  Finally, we should have some action around here!  *giggle*<BR>

Furchin says [to mielikki] : No, he hasn't. He was up around 8 central though.<BR>
Mielikki sticks an ice cube down Karn's jerkin and then hides the ice bucket near Furchin.<BR>
Mielikki tickles you.<BR>
Mielikki says [to furchin] : He probably went to eat lunch and forgot to come back. *sigh*<BR>
Furchin thanks Mielikki for the ice, and puts it to good use by melting it, then dumping the water on Karn.<BR>
Mielikki says [to furchin] : Or took a "longer" lunch break. *giggle*<BR>
Furchin says [to mielikki] : He was out for 70 some minutes, came back at 8, then started husking again.<BR>
Mielikki says [to furchin] : If Westril finds him sleeping and husked, she's going to put a pink tutu on him and ribbons in his hair. (-;<BR>
Furchin says [to mielikki] : You can tell her where you are :)<BR>
Mielikki is going to go watch something while <b>SOMEONE</b> continues to husk.  *sniff*<BR>
