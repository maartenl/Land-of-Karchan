Deputy Rules
------------

0. Deputies should not misuse their powers. (this is a general rule, and can be interpreted in a lot of ways, one of the most common ones is that the deps do not obtain private player information unless for solving problems/aiding the game)

1. Deputies should not "help" normal players in extravagant ways. (for
example making them invulnerable, giving them money, telling what to do
and where to do it, giving them huge battle axes or big hitpoints so nobody
can kill them)

2. Overall/Global changes to the game should be discussed (through
for example email) with ALL deputies and Karn. Only afterwards may any
global/overall change take place. Global changes will only be executed by
Karn, as they have a huge impact on the game and could make the game
unstable or even unoperable.

4. Deputies will not react to (complaining) offensive emails, but will
ignore them with the disdain that these emails deserve.

5. Deputies must leave their feelings and other baggage
 the mud!!! This game is hard enough to administer
without letting characters/deputies/Karn get to you. If you cannot control
your feelings it is better to not be a deputy.

6. Karn has the right to VETO changes if he feels that they do not stroke 
with the nature of the game. 
(I found The Stick of Multiple-Target Decimation funny, but
lets be serious here) However, he should use this right sparingly.

7. Karn has the right to bring in changes to the game, without permission
from deps, but these changes do need to be in character with the game. Karn
does have the obligation however of communicating these changes with the deps
first.


Any other suggestions and ideas?
