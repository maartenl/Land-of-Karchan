Provides operations for dealing with items. To be more specific, it is
dealing primarily with the logistics regarding items (who has what, what is
lying where, etc...)<P>
Items are not kept in memory in a pool, for memory reasons. The number of
items is too large to do this. All item manipulation is directly transmitted
to the database.
