Provides operations for dealing with rooms that contain items and
characters. The way the game handles rooms is that it keeps all rooms
that have been visited by characters in memory, while committing changes to
the database. If a character visits a room that is not present yet, the room
is added to the pool.<P>
This means that every one in a while a cleanup of the rooms is required.
