Provides for the different races of Characters in the game.<P>
Contains the different races possible in the game. If a new race must be
defined, a corresponding class must be created here. Races carry special
modifiers indicating advantages and disadvantages. Races are usually derived
from StdRace, where the game engine uses the Race interface for all
common methods.
