  minclanmembers
  clandescription
  clanurl
attributes:
- clanname

First, you need to use the clancreate command to create a new clan. You
have to get at least MINCLANMEMBERS amount of new members before it will
activate you (Set in the INI file). Activation means you will be visible in
the listing, can buy land for the clan, can have clan bank accounts, and can
hire mobs, as well as have politics with others.

Once you've made your clan, people can 'clanapply' to the clan. Of course,
the person has to be at least level MINCLANLEVEL (Set in the INI file).
'clanapply' can be done even if you're the only one online. Clan bosses can
set qualifications to the clan with the 'clanqual' command and both bosses
and leaders will see new applicants in their 'clandetails' screen, at which
point, they can 'clanaccept' or 'clanreject' the player (regardless of
online status). Clan bosses can also 'clanassign' people roles, such as
treasurer, leader, or even boss. Clan bosses and leaders may, at any time,
'clanexile' a member - as well as members can 'clanresign'

Once you're accepted into a clan, you can use the clantalk channel to talk
to your clan, as well as use the 'Clan Home' and 'Clan Donate' spells. The
'clanhome' location and the 'clandonate' location can be set by bosses using
the 'clanhomeset' and 'clandonateset' commands. Bosses and treasurers may
deal with any Clan bankers in your game. If MINCLANMEMBERS don't at least
login in DAYSCLANDEATH days, then the clan will be purged automatically.
