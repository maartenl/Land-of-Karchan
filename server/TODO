TODO
----

- make the admin scripts so that deps can make changes and changes are
committed to the log and the owner of the object is changed appropriately.
- Add 'plurals' to the items. (bucket -> buckets)
- logging is split up into the different characters. This makes it easier to
debug in a production environment.
- remove gold,silver from mm_usertable, mm_items,only use copper as a
flat-base value.
- boards
- add %SLONG, %TLONG
- fighting
- inserts and deletes of items/rooms/methods/commands/events
- insert/change/delete attributes
- search something
- check that the stream has not ended in MudSocket, it will return a null
pointer. ugly.
- setAttribute+removeAttribute should submit information to the database.
BUT NOT FOR ItemDefs!

- open something/close something
- look <IN> object
- lock something/unlock something
- check that a person does not wield more than one thing.

- events:
  openevent(person, item)
	- occurrs when item is successfully opened by a person
	- methodname found in attribute "openevent"
	- refers to source code in methods table
	- attribute available in item
  closeevent(person, item)
	- occurrs when item is successfully closed by a person
	- methodname found in attribute "closeevent"
	- refers to source code in methods table
	- attribute available in item
  receiveitemevent(person, person, item)
  enterevent(person, room)
  leaveevent(person, room)
- check if an object is being wielded.
- IMPORTANT! If any one command/event/method is generating an exception,
make certain that it it removed from the list of executable commands, and that
the "callable" field in the database is deactivated.
- add 'fight' and 'stop fighting' commands to the help.

Items
-----

The following kind of items are possible:
- DRINK
- FOOD
- ARMOUR
- WEAPON
- JEWELRY
- GUILDITEM
- MAGICITEM
- NORMAL
- CONTAINER
- SHOPKEERPITEM

An Item has a getter "isSellable" containing most of the logic about wehter
or not an item is sellable.

Creating Items
--------------

Items should be able to be created by combining any number of <I>other</I>
items.

Containers
----------

Containers are special items that can contain other items. Containers, teh
same as normal items have a ItemDefinition, have an ContainerDefinition. It
contains, besides the usual stuff of ItemDefinition, specific default
behaviour about the containers.

The ItemDefinition determines if an item is a container or not.
It does this in a variety of ways. First of all, if the 'container' field is
set to 'yes', the item is a container, capable of containing other items.

If the 'isopenable' field is set to 'yes' the container can be opened and
closed.

if the 'keyid' field is set to a VALID itemdefinition, an item of that
definition is to be used to lock or unlock the container.

As this means that a container has a varying number of states, attributes
are used per container:

name: islocked value: false value_type: boolean
name: isopen value: true value_type: boolean
name: isopenable value: true value_type: boolean

A container cannot contain a non-empty container. We are not going to have
infinite-level-depth containers. That way madness lies.

Guilds
-----

A. Below text issues the following commands:
V guildapply GUILDNAME
- (BOSS) guildqual MINGUILDLEVEL
V guilddetails
V (BOSS) guildaccept USERNAME
V (BOSS) guildreject USERNAME
V (BOSS) guildassign USERNAME "RANK"
V (BOSS) guildaddrank "RANKID" "RANK DESC"
V (BOSS) guilddelrank "RANKID"
- (BOSS) guildexile USERNAME, REASON
V (BOSS) guildremove USERNAME
V guildleave
- (BOSS) guildrefresh

V (BOSS) guilddescription
V (BOSS) guildtitle
V (BOSS) guildurl
- (BOSS) guildlevel

V (BOSS) guildmessage LOGONMESSSAGE
V guild MESSAGE
- guildhome
- guilddonate
- admin guildhomeset

Need to check the following into Database.java:
- check Attribute on mm_charattributes
- check guildname on mm_usertable
- remove Attribute from mm_charattributes
- set guildname in mm_usertable
This is only required for the follwoing commands:
V (BOSS) guildaccept USERNAME
V (BOSS) guildreject USERNAME

mm_guilds
* name
  title -> userdefined
  daysguilddeath
  maxguilddeath
  minguildmembers
  minguildlevel -> userdefined
  guilddescription -> userdefined
  guildurl => userdefined
  bossname
  active
  creation
  owner
  logonmessage text -> new
mm_charattributes
name: guildrank
value: 20
value_type: integer
charname: Karn
mm_guildranks
* name
  title
  guildlevel -> 1=bottom rung, 100=top rung=automatic BOSS
* guildname
First, you need to use the guildcreate command to create a new guild. You
have to get at least MINGUILDMEMBERS amount of new members before it will
activate you (Set in the INI file). Activation means you will be visible in
the listing, can buy land for the guild, can have guild bank accounts, and can
hire mobs, as well as have politics with others.

Once you've made your guild, people can 'guildapply' to the guild. Of course,
the person has to be at least level MINGUILDLEVEL (Set in the INI file).
'guildapply' can be done even if you're the only one online. Clan bosses can
set qualifications to the guild with the 'guildqual' command and both bosses
and leaders will see new applicants in their 'guilddetails' screen, at which
point, they can 'guildaccept' or 'guildreject' the player (regardless of
online status). Clan bosses can also 'guildassign' people roles, such as
treasurer, leader, or even boss. Clan bosses and leaders may, at any time,
'guildexile' a member - as well as members can 'guildresign'

Once you're accepted into a guild, you can use the guildtalk channel to talk
to your guild, as well as use the 'Clan Home' and 'Clan Donate' spells. The
'guildhome' location can be set by bosses using
the 'guildhomeset' commands. Bosses and treasurers may
deal with any Clan bankers in your game. If MINGUILDMEMBERS don't at least
login in DAYSGUILDDEATH days, then the guild will be purged automatically. 
http://www.turf.org/helps/

GUILDITEMS=> a guild should have special items, that can only be shared/used
among guildmembers. Changes from guild to another guild automatically destroy
guilditems or something.

Shopkeepers
-----------

Shopkeepers buy and sell items. Some shopkeepers will only allow selling and
buying of specific items. 
Shopkeepers have a finite amount of money, when the money runs out, the
shopkeeper will not buy items.
If an item does not appear in the list of buyable/sellable items, it will
not be sold/bought.
You can only buy items that the shopkeepers has in his/her inventory.

Issue: how do I determine what a shopkeeper has for sale at the moment.
answer: special item? in database with special attribute? A sort of "View"
item.

Issue: how do I determine how much a shopkeeper is willing to give for a
certain item?
answer: show item

Current commands for shopkeepers:
buy <item> from <shopkeeper>
sell <item> to <shopkeeper>
show <item> to <shopkeeper>

Money
-----

V remove gold,silver from mm_usertable. Keep copper for use as a base-value
for the amount of money someone has.
V remove gold, silver from mm_items. Keep copper for use as a base-value
for the amount of money someone has.
Money is not an Item unless it is part of a room/item.
When retrieving money from a room/corpse => moneybag, moneypouch, coinbag
There is never any loose change.
- a Room does not contain coins, a room contains moneybags.
V There is never 10 silver coins, it is always 1 gold
V There is never 10 copper coins, it is always 1 silver
V Fortune 500 list
- Ziektekostenverzekering
- een Baan (blacksmith, fisherman)

impacts the following objects:
- SellCommand
- BuyCommand
- DropCommand
- GetCommand
- PutCommand
- RetrieveCommand
- Database
- Person
- Item
- Room

Menders
-------

Items have, for each, a 'condition', for example: mint condition, perfect
condition, bad shape, worse.
Itemdefs define a 'maxcondition', which is by default a maximum of 28*6=168
days. (a little less than half a year).
Items that are newly created automatically have the maximum condition.
Every day, the items deteriorate a little (crontab?).
When deterioration reaches zero, the item is disintegrated!
Items can be repaired, bringing their condition back to 'mint' by repairmen.
There are general items, specific items, that can be <I>mended</I> by
<I>menders</I> (think: repairmen).


Quests
------

Quests are basically where you have to ask some guy, get s	ome stuff, ask
some other guy. 

Addendum: you also have to kill certain bad guys. This is solved by having
each of the specific badguys carry an invisible (?) questitem or something
similar.

Addendum: Some quests are repeatable, and some are not. Quests that are repeatable
need not have an attribute set.
Quests are chainable, which means a quest can only be aquired when another
quest has been completed. Quests are in fact linked.

Have questionmarks next to the name of a bot that are clickable. One
questionmark for each quest. -> global change, make all persons return a
'normalname' and a 'clickable name'. The same should go for items.

When monsters die they must respawn in a set interval.

Preconditions for accepting the quest:
- person must not already have the quest (check attribute)
- previous quest must have been complete when this quest is accepted.
- persons level must be >= minlevel
- persons level must be <= maxlevel
- fromperson must be a bot
- toperson must be a bot

A quest table in the database could look like this:
mm_quests : indicates a certain quest to be fulfilled
* questid		int not null
  name          varchar(255) not null
  description   text not null
  minlevel      int,
  maxlevel      int,
  exp           int not null,
  fromperson	varchar(20) not null,
  toperson      varchar(20) not null,
  previousquest	int, (can be null, then a non-chained quest)
  methodname varchar(52), (can be null, thenno script is run on completing the
quest)
  creation
  owner
mm_questitems : indicates how many of which item are needed to complete a
certain quest. 
* itemid		int not null
* questid 		int not null
  amount  		int not null default 1
  visible       int(1) not null default 1
mm_questchar : indicates which persons have completed a certain quest
* questid		int not null
* name 			varchar(20) not null



Ignore lists
------------

Ignore lists are lists containing people that are ignoring other people.
People can add or delete members from their ignorelist.

mm_ignore
	fromperson varchar(20) not null,
	toperson varchar(20) not null,
	foreignkey fromperson -> usertable
	forgeinkey toperson -> usertable

commands:
ignore <person>
acknowledge <person>

Change the output/input methods (messages/personal) to check for
ignoring characters.

Every User character should have a "isBeingIgnoredBy" list. It gets updated
whenever they logon to the game.

It gets changed whenever someone issues an Ignore/Ack command.

communication+mudmail+boards must perform a check before sending to see if the
perosn
is being ignored by the target.

Economy
-------

The economy of a mud is a very important aspect.

Over time, the amount of posessions in the mud is going to increase.
Therefore, inflation will occur. This is a common characteristic to all
mud/mmorpg/mush/moos.

One of the main reasons for a increase in inflation is a direct consequence
of Administration. There are a few ways to curtail the following
occurrences:
- too many items occur
- too powerful/expensive items occur

Both of these are a direct result of improper administration of
Wizards/Deputies/Gods of the mud. It is vital that the administration of the
mud is curtailed by rules/measures.

The following measures can be taken:
- gold/silver/copper cannot be set for an item, it is computed by the worth
of an item
- the worth of an item consists of a combination of factors:
	- how fast does an item deteriorate
	- what level of armour does it provide
	- what level of damage does it provide per second
	- what bonus/buffs does it have
- droprate cannot be set for an item, it is computed by the worth of an
item, droprate is the amount of times the item will be dropped by certain
monsters
- level cannot be set for an item, it is computed by the worth of an item,
level is the level at which the item can be used by a player/bot.
- the aquirement of items is not instantaneous... ALL stuff that can be done
must be done within a defined timeframe. This can differ from 1 second to 1
minute.
- any action taken, interrupts the action in progress


You say : Difficult to say:

    * improving the current game to include stuff that all orpg have
    * (professions, items, fighting, levelling, etc)
    * implement AJAX
    * start up a new game using JMonkey (uhuh, if that ever gets off the
    * ground, I need an artist for that)
    * see if I can make heaps of money (with this mud?) so I don't have to
    * go looking for a job anymore
    * perhaps add banners to the website/logonpage, adSense? Would that
    * help? 

Blackfyre says [to you] : The mud most of the game's players frequent when
this one is unavailable is called Hollow, I believe it's the one that
branched off of your mud from 12 years ago. They have a number of
money-making setups on it. I mention because one girl confessed to me just
last week that she spends over a hundred dollars there a week.

Blackfyre says [to you] : I do not, however, agree with most of them, like
charging players for houses, say.

Blackfyre says [to you] : I'd an idea for banners for places like Barns &
Noble Bookseller, or the like. Things that Karchanians are likely to buy
anyway. Instead of forced stuff they would likely never click on.

Blackfyre says [to you] : Oh! And in such a case, can I move in with you? I
have no money either and that would, pardon my American, Fucking Rock.


Blackfyre will accept anonymous fame, if it would get him a room in a
castle. Tower room. Tallest one.
Ronan says : Someone could make a Youtube video? Thats free, as I understand
it. Gets mad hits if its got theatrics. People love flashy.
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : Wait, he stops having Thanksgiving dinner?
Ephinie says [to Blackfyre] : Right. I think we should make a podcast where
we interview different players and ask them all kinds of personal questions
and stuffs about their characters, how they came up with their more
well-known ones, ect.
Ephinie says : And you know, anything else amusing that we might think up to
ask.
Ronan says [to Blackfyre] : Unless he is eating while simultaneously
shitting.
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : Thaeloc will dance like a monkey on film... I've
also got other attention whores around me I could put to use, and good
equipment. Thing is, there's nothing to, uh... Film.
Ronan says [to Ephinie] : "So when did realize you were a permanent noob?"
Blackfyre says [to Ephinie] : "Never mention ('interviews') , in my
presence. I'll KILL you." ;)
Blackfyre is certain that if he has to hear one more stranger pontificate
for hours about their character creation methods he'll become a serial
murderer.
Ronan says [to Blackfyre] : Sure there is. Take shots of the game, and then
some of the surrounding sites pretaining to the game and then talk alot on
camera "You don't act like a Doctor, you act like a game show host." Talk
alot, make the footage snappy and people will flock. Thing is, you want to
make it look bigger than it really is. Thats when it starts getting bigger.
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : "What exactly were you ON, when you thought that
was a good thing to say?"
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : Well, I can do either I suppose. I've been doing
a newscaster thing a lot lately, as I watch far too much Daily Show and the
like.
Blackfyre is a member of the "C-Section".
Ephinie says [to Blackfyre] : We could make it like... a trivia contest?
Ephinie says : About Karchan history...
Ronan says [to Blackfyre] : "Does the rest of the game know you are that
good? Because I heard your rp style, in terms of style and fluditiy, is the
total equivalent of a Siamese cat in heat with thumbtacs sticking out its
anus. Just saying, thats what I heard."
Ronan says [to Blackfyre] : You have a newscast and you didn't tell me?
Blackfyre says : A local highly out-spoken republican woman was struck down
by a vehicle in an accidental collision today. Volunteer Fire Department
members on the scene say that she suffered only minor injuries when the car
struck her, but severed a finger when then tossed to the ground.
Blackfyre says : Austin doctors say she will recovery fully, but will be
unable to express her views on the healthcare debate for 6 weeks.
Ronan says : Wait, what is it exactly we are talking about doing? Promoting
to a new audience? Cooing towards a new demographic? Its like George Carlin
dressed up as a Priest would say. "Hook'em while they're young."
Ephinie says [to Blackfyre] : He's right, you know. About your RP style.
Ronan chuckles.
Blackfyre points to a picture that has popped up next to his head of a
person flipping off the camera. A cast appears around the hand so the
gesture is now covered.
Blackfyre blushes to Ephinie.
Ronan says : All of this reminds me, we have to have an Obsidian discussion
pretty soon here.
Blackfyre says [to Ephinie] : You're sweet. :)
Blackfyre cringes from Ronan.
Ronan cringes from Ronan.
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : Just for that I made my title better than yours.
Take that, lesser geek!
Ephinie says [to Ronan] : He's my daddy.
Blackfyre removes Ronan's pocket protector, drops it, then stomps on it
ineffectively.
Blackfyre says [to Ephinie] : But, I thought I was your daddy?
Blackfyre cries, drinks a fifth, then calls an ex-girlfriend.
Ephinie says [to Blackfyre] : No, you're my Sugar Daddy.
Blackfyre says : I'm waiting on my freewebs account to be accessible btw,
before I try to fix all my Ammerville rooms, as the picture links are
wonked. :)
Blackfyre hangs up the phone really quickly then unplugs it.
Ronan says [to Ephinie] : I imagine that thrills you to no end. He wants to
off the character within the next week. We really really need to decide what
should happen here, and also I have an idea for our deity hierarchy as a
whole.
Blackfyre says [to Ephinie] : Whew!
Ronan says [to Blackfyre] : That one had the christmas lights on it :(
Blackfyre raises his hand to Ronan.
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : Pick me! Ooo, o!
Ronan says [to Blackfyre] : Mine sounds like something the Sheriff would
bestow, nancy boy.
Ronan says [to Blackfyre] : Go!
Ephinie says [to Ronan] : Well... whatever happens with Obisdian is going to
have to be decided without him having to hear or speak to me, because he
decided to never talk to me again after I supposedly "coerced" him into a DD
with Adumar. Mind you, I did this without even being online, seeing, or
speaking to him... But the end result is this player now wants nothing to do
with me ever.
Ephinie says [to Blackfyre] : *girly voice* Daaaaaaaaaddy!
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : Zhanos made his sons fight over the title after
he left, and so Dagorii helped Obsidian get it from Osnodon and Kulanin so
he could remain battle lord :)
Krice appears.
Krice leaves north.
Blackfyre makes a sound like he's choking, then a face like he's about to
sneeze, then falls over.
Blackfyre goes to change his pants.
Ronan says [to Ephinie] : Yeah, but by now I think we have basically decided
not to truly listen to what pours out his maw. I don't care what happens as
long as the person who gets the title is sufficiently capable of the role.
Blackfyre digs around in the avalanche debris here, getting quite dirty.
~ Blackfyre finds a diamond!
Blackfyre gives a sparkling, clear, gem diamond to Ephinie.
Ephinie beams at Blackfyre.
Ronan says [to Blackfyre] : As far as I am concerned, we could spiral out a
hugely cool roleplay in which Zhanos returns. I take it the original player
won't do it, but if anyone can get into contact with him maybe he would be
down with a new cat playing the part. And that brings me to the other thing.
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : Have you watched 'The Guild' yet? That's doing
well on the web, very well, we could play off that.
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : 'd thought about Mike, but we'd have to really
stalk him to find him. I've forgotten his surname at the moment.
Ephinie says [to Ronan] : In all honesty... I would take it, but I just
don't want to. I don't want to have anything to do with that legacy.
Blackfyre says : And anyway, longshot.
Blackfyre says : We could arbitrarily declare Mya the Goddess of Evil? That
would rule.
Blackfyre says : Tell her Karn said so, all that.
Blackfyre is inserting ideas about previous conversation topics into the
current one, yes, whatchugonnado?
Ephinie says [to Blackfyre] : I like it.
Blackfyre bangs an imaginary gavel on an imaginary gavel banging thingy.
Ephinie says [to Ronan] : Why can't we just pawn it all off on Yasec?
Blackfyre says : Next item on the agenda! Declaring Blackfyre the God of
#&!*. All opposed say ekki-ekki-ekki-pitang-zoom-boing-*trails of
# incoherantly*
Ronan says [to Ephinie] : The thing is, I would love to do it. And I don't
# mind taking it, but we all have to understand that Its going to stick on
# my list of crap needed to be done and that i'm still doing here, and I'm
# worried I won't be completely active.
Blackfyre says : All for, say Yeayah.
Blackfyre wonders if one can actually choke on guilt... He will have to keep
an eye on Ronan's local paper.
Ronan says : Ok, so I thought about about a few ways in order to solve our
delimma of players using God alts. My compromise is this. There needs to be
a set deity list by which we all concur, completely that the people therein
are the Gods of Karchan. No more dying and replacing them, its happening too
often. I've whined about that plenty I guess, but onward. The 'God' alts are
owned by the Deputies and Karn, nobody else. They are played by people who
we all agree won't screw things up, and when that person is done, a new cat
can come along and take over the same character. Therefore, Ed plays
'Obsidian', then 'Steve', then 'Michelle' so on and so forth. They are
welcome to do their own thing with it, but at the end of their spheel the
'God', always owned by the Deps, can pass it on. This might sound funky, but
Its kindof guildish in essence. corporate sponsorship. Now obviously this
might not work well with some of the ones already current, Nightshade tops
my list, but I think we can probably get the whole thing squared away if we
handle it right. Ok, go.
Ephinie says [to Ronan] : Well... do we know any regular players that would
A: Want the position, B: Be capable of handling the position, and C: not be
a douchebag to players oocly?
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : Hey, that's MY Deific Office idea, just said a
total different way!
Blackfyre says : Rodolphus?
Blackfyre says [to Ephinie] : Don't hit me!
Blackfyre hides behind Karn.
Ephinie says [to Ronan] : The difficulty with that would, of course, be how
to handle Nightshade and other gods created by players. Like Yasec too, for
example. He had a history before he was a god, ect. ect. I think most of the
played gods do.
Ronan says [to Ephinie] : Sure we do. Off the top of my head, I can name
five.
Ephinie says [to Blackfyre] : Why would I hit my Sugar Daddy?
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : A 'Plan B' could be letting the office rot, and
having the high priest or such take the role. We Deputies could send them
missives by logging into the character, whenever we've an RP idea we've
decided on enacting, and let them work it out themselves.
Blackfyre says : Them the players.
Ephinie says [to Ronan] : Who are they?
Blackfyre says : ronan Five??
Ronan says [to Ephinie] : Yeah, but parts of the land already have a
history, don't they? Players just obey it because
Blackfyre has been working on documenting history, a freaklot, but can only
do so much without pontificating or conjecting.
Ephinie says [to Ronan] : Then I don't see a problem other than getting
players who already own their own characters to agree. But in all honesty, I
think Nightshade's player is here to stay. He's been here for like twelve
years.
SkyeFyre grins maliciously at Blackfyre and pounces on him. After tussling
for a minute, SkyeFyre and Blackfyre both sit up, breathing hard.
Blackfyre grins to you.
Blackfyre says [to you] : It will take forever to read any good ideas
through our banter. :)
Ronan says : Ben, Lisa, Helena, Caly, possibly Cristina. I emphasize the
'possibly' on the last one.
Blackfyre says [to SkyeFyre] : Ha! I'm painting houses, just one color,
nothing artistic. Though, my skill is great. I should paint again, it's been
a long time.
Ephinie says [to Ronan] : I vote Ben or Helena.
Blackfyre has NO idea who those people are.
Ronan says [to Ephinie] : Right, but Shade doesn't bother me. The chances of
Andy becoming stupid are not very good. The worries I have are based on the
ones who screw the game up when they log in.
SkyeFyre says [to Blackfyre] : I assumed you meant the other kind of
painting, but still. My house is three or four different colors. My dad is
special.
You say [to Blackfyre] : Cut&Paste, my man.
Blackfyre grins to SkyeFyre.
Blackfyre bows to you.
Ronan is whispering something to Ephinie, but you cannot hear what.
SkyeFyre says [to Blackfyre] : I mean my other dad. *winks*
Ronan waves to SkyeFyre.
Ronan is totally not in character.
Ephinie says [to you] : But the banter is so much fun.
SkyeFyre drops a curtsey to you.
SkyeFyre rubs her nose. It looks runny.
SkyeFyre pokes Ronan.
Ephinie is whispering something to Ronan, but you cannot hear what.
Ronan wouldn't know where to start cutting and then pasting now.
SkyeFyre says : Well, enough of that. Goodnight everybody.
SkyeFyre cuddles Blackfyre.
SkyeFyre leaves north.
Ronan says [to you] : I may never get a chance to ask this again. Is there
any possibility we could reopen the bank in Pendulis?

Blackfyre says [to you] : We SHOULD, however, have an official like meeting
or something, like next week around this time or the like, to give Argo and
Midevia a chance to show up. Mya can't at the moment, and Cedri is MIA.
Blackfyre says [to you] : I will wanna move in with you.
Blackfyre only needs 3 cubic meters, access to a toilet, and 32 wall
sockets.
You comfort Blackfyre.
Blackfyre chuckles.
Blackfyre says : "Castle Karchan
You say [to Blackfyre] : Next week, .. okies... what time?
Blackfyre makes like he's riding a horse around his front lawn.
Blackfyre says [to you] : Hmm... Say noonish. :)
Blackfyre DID mention he had no money, back earlier.
Ronan says : The Crack of Noon.
Blackfyre grins.
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : Damn straight! I'll never get up before noon,
not even in another time zone! :)
Ronan says [to Blackfyre] : We need a board room in the sky.
Blackfyre says : I've over 400 days of movies, if played back to back, and
an issue of Amazing Spider-Man # 102 :)
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : Hah!
Ephinie says : Wednesdays and Thursdays are best for me.
Ronan says [to you] : I take it with new functionality comes great amounts
of new coding shit I need to memorize?
Ronan is good whenever. He has no life, and therefore only a pirate port to
keep him occupied.
A soft yet heady aroma of rose petals drifts through the area. It seems to
be coming from Ephinie.
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : Pirate port! I KNEW you were flitty! Hah!~
Blackfyre says : Is that one still in use, and or insulting? "Flitty?" 60s
vernacular; Salinger
Blackfyre says [to you] : I have a philosophy that letting the players have
a great amount of ability to affect the game world, like building a house,
planting a garden, lighting the neighbor's house on fire, so on, is where
it's at.
Ronan says [to Blackfyre] : Thats what she said.
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : Oh!
Ephinie says [to Blackfyre] : I have a philosophy that houses shouldn't be
built on spaces that are already occupied. In other words, I am a fan of
grids. So there need to be guidelines about where players can put things.
Blackfyre says [to you] : I choe the term affect purposely, not effect.
Ronan says : Check out the Forest south of here. Esh
Blackfyre says [to Ephinie] : I can buy that, sorta, I guess, but if you
must then I must insist that distances outside of cities should be far
greater than inside them.
Blackfyre says [to Ephinie] : And houses are smaller than city blocks! :)
Blackfyre punches air. Nailed it.
Ephinie says [to Blackfyre] : I can be down with that. I'm just sick of...
like... the forest south of here. Yeah. Like he said.
Ephinie says : And has anyone poked around the maze under the BK castle
lately? *rubs headache away*
Blackfyre says [to you] : Ronan's point about getting them young holds true,
and more than one the majority of new players come form word-of-mouth in
high schools, and amongst teenaged friends.
Blackfyre says : Someone finds us by accident, and then tells their group of
RP-intested friends.
Blackfyre and Karn are still clueless about the forest south of here. Fyre,
for one, does NOT want to check it out.
Ronan says [to you] : Also, they come from Tarkio, Missouri. I've no idea
why.
Blackfyre says : I held that Karn's areas were immutable, and that we could
add access to our own created areas through a point he approved. That was
back in the day, though. Milady tore up the Enchanted Wood with her Grove of
Nature stuff, and He allowed her to leave it afterward, so the dynamic
changed there, and then He's made like RL's God a long time since.
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : I'ma skeered of that place.
Ronan says : I honestly don't see why everyone needs to have an actual
working house. To be honest, i'm in favor of the idea that Karchan doesn't
need to be the PlayStation 3, it should be the box :)
Blackfyre plays the soundtrack from an old 'grindhouse' movie.
Ronan secretly thinks all of the addons are mucking up the scenery.
Ephinie cries.
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : I put christmas lights in my box, and then read
books in there. And I also watched Lost in Space in it on a tiny old black
and white tv.
Blackfyre says : I was seven. Boxes fucking suck.
Blackfyre says [to Ephinie] : It's ok, they don't come FROM there, they go
TO there.
Blackfyre says [to Ephinie] : It is your fault though. It IS.
Blackfyre grins to Ronan.
Ronan scoffs. He made his box an imaginary rocketship. :(
Blackfyre makes gestures of the pariah at Ephinie.
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : Ground Control to Major Tard, people don't pay
for boxes. :) The man wants a living! :)
Blackfyre says [to Ronan] : You guys just got yourself your very own 'Good
Old Days', when Karchan used to be this and that. :):(
Ephinie asks [to Blackfyre] : How is it MY fault?
Blackfyre wants 10% over the vig.
Ronan says [to Blackfyre] : I will cut you.
Blackfyre says [to Ephinie] : You talked to them. I told you, but noooo, you
were all *girly voice* "Karchanians are nice" and now you have people. :)
Stop being so sexy and they might leave you alone :)
Blackfyre grins to Ronan.
