TODO
----

- make the admin scripts so that deps can make changes and changes are
committed to the log and the owner of the object is changed appropriately.
- Add 'plurals' to the items. (bucket -> buckets)
- logging is split up into the different characters. This makes it easier to
debug in a production environment.
- remove gold,silver from mm_usertable, mm_items,only use copper as a
flat-base value.
- boards
- add %SLONG, %TLONG
- fighting
- inserts and deletes of items/rooms/methods/commands/events
- insert/change/delete attributes
- search something
- check that the stream has not ended in MudSocket, it will return a null
pointer. ugly.
- setAttribute+removeAttribute should submit information to the database.
BUT NOT FOR ItemDefs!

- open something/close something
- look <IN> object
- lock something/unlock something
- check that a person does not wield more than one thing.

- events:
  openevent(person, item)
	- occurrs when item is successfully opened by a person
	- methodname found in attribute "openevent"
	- refers to source code in methods table

  receiveitemevent(person, person, item)
  enterevent(person, room)
  leaveevent(person, room)
- check if an object is being wielded.
- IMPORTANT! If any one command/event/method is generating an exception,
make certain that it it removed from the list of executable commands, and that
the "callable" field in the database is deactivated.
- add 'fight' and 'stop fighting' commands to the help.

Items
-----
The following kind of items are possible:
- DRINK
- FOOD
- ARMOUR
- WEAPON
- JEWELRY
- CLANITEM
- MAGICITEM
- NORMAL

Clans
-----

A. Below text issues the following commands:
- admin clancreate CLANNAME DAYSCLANDEATH MINCLANMEMBERS BOSSNAME
- clanapply CLANNAME
- clanqual
- clandetails USERNAME
- clanaccept USERNAME
- clanreject USERNAME
- clanassign USERNAME, "ROLE"
- clanexile USERNAME, REASON
- clantalk MESSAGE
- clanhome
- clandonate
- clanhomeset
- clandonateset

mm_clans
* name
  daysclandeath
  minclanmembers
  clandescription
  clanurl
attributes:
- clanname

First, you need to use the clancreate command to create a new clan. You
have to get at least MINCLANMEMBERS amount of new members before it will
activate you (Set in the INI file). Activation means you will be visible in
the listing, can buy land for the clan, can have clan bank accounts, and can
hire mobs, as well as have politics with others.

Once you've made your clan, people can 'clanapply' to the clan. Of course,
the person has to be at least level MINCLANLEVEL (Set in the INI file).
'clanapply' can be done even if you're the only one online. Clan bosses can
set qualifications to the clan with the 'clanqual' command and both bosses
and leaders will see new applicants in their 'clandetails' screen, at which
point, they can 'clanaccept' or 'clanreject' the player (regardless of
online status). Clan bosses can also 'clanassign' people roles, such as
treasurer, leader, or even boss. Clan bosses and leaders may, at any time,
'clanexile' a member - as well as members can 'clanresign'

Once you're accepted into a clan, you can use the clantalk channel to talk
to your clan, as well as use the 'Clan Home' and 'Clan Donate' spells. The
'clanhome' location and the 'clandonate' location can be set by bosses using
the 'clanhomeset' and 'clandonateset' commands. Bosses and treasurers may
deal with any Clan bankers in your game. If MINCLANMEMBERS don't at least
login in DAYSCLANDEATH days, then the clan will be purged automatically.

CLANITEMS=> a clan should have special items, that can only be shared/used
among clanmembers. Changes from clan to another clan automatically destroy
clanitems or something.

Shopkeepers
-----------

Shopkeepers buy and sell items. Some shopkeepers will only allow selling and
buying of specific items. 
Shopkeepers have a finite amount of money, when the money runs out, the
shopkeeper will not buy items.
If an item does not appear in the list of buyable/sellable items, it will
not be sold/bought.
You can only buy items that the shopkeepers has in his/her inventory.

Issue: how do I determine what a shopkeeper has for sale at the moment.

Issue: how do I determine how much a shopkeeper is willing to give for a
certain item?

Current commands for shopkeepers:
buy <item> from <shopkeeper>
sell <item> to <shopkeeper>

Money
-----

- remove gold,silver from mm_usertable. Keep copper for use as a base-value
for the amount of money someone has.
- remove gold, silver from mm_items. Keep copper for use as a base-value
for the amount of money someone has.
Money is not an Item unless it is part of a room/item.

Menders
-------

Items have, for each, a 'condition', for example: mint condition, perfect
condition, bad shape, worse.
Itemdefs define a 'maxcondition', which is by default a maximum of 28*6=168
days. (a little less than half a year).
Items that are newly created automatically have the maximum condition.
Every day, the items deteriorate a little (crontab?).
When deterioration reaches zero, the item is disintegrated!
Items can be repaired, bringing their condition back to 'mint' by repairmen.
There are general items, specific items, that can be <I>mended</I> by
<I>menders</I> (think: repairmen).
