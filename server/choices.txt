- It is impossible at this time, due to memory requirements, to keep all
items as separate objects in memory. Therefore I've chosen to, with regards
to items, keep all access to the items on the database level and to not
perform any caching. For rooms and characters this should not be a problem,
as the characters will not exceed 20 in most cases and very few rooms are
normally used.

- It might be a good idea to periodically flush the cached rooms, though.
Within time, the caching will take up quite a big part.

- It is not a good idea to keep "amount" with the items, because it provides
a logistical nightmare, and makesit impossible (or difficult) to provide
unique abilities to certain items.

- It is better to have different itemtables, for rooms/items/characters, in
order to keep the primary key as best as possible. When moving items from
the table over to another table, it is best to:
1. retrieve itemids
2. remove itemids from table (reserving itemids)
3. add itemids to another table
