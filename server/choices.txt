- sleeping?
- there should be a definite method for determining if a person is "valid",
i.e. does he exist, in the same room, is visible, and a host of other
settings. There should be a gerneal method for checking this.
- items should be "reservered" and then used. For example when dealing with
shopkeepers :
	-	reserve item from shopkeeper : int Person.reserveItem(stuff)
	-	in case of problem -> returns ItemException
	-	do coin check
	-	in case of problem -> move item back into person : Person.addItem(stuff)
	-	in case of OK -> start removing coins from persons account and
		move item into a new person inventory : Person.addItem(stuff)
possibilities: - do everything at once in the database
				- do selective stuff in the database, and reissue queries
					when necessary.

Implementation
--------------

- I split up Database.java in different static objects, that request the
connection from Database.java in order to have some semblance of order. It
becomes difficult to find the correct method in a huge Database object.

- It is impossible at this time, due to memory requirements, to keep all
items as separate objects in memory. Therefore I've chosen to, with regards
to items, keep all access to the items on the database level and to not
perform any caching. For rooms and characters this should not be a problem,
as the characters will not exceed 20 in most cases and very few rooms are
normally used. 

- Addendum to the previous point: However, I feel having an item object
facilitates matters immensely, and I should make use of it. The one thing
that I need to remember than, is not to keep any of the item objects in
memory. I.e. have them garbage collected as soon as they leave scope, and
reissue a query to the database whenever the item has been garbage collected
and needs to be recreated.

- Second Addendum: I do, however, take the same approach with the item
definitions as with the rooms and characters. I assume that the
itemdefinitions will not grow exorbitantly, as in general a small amount of
items will be used in the game.

- It might be a good idea to periodically flush the cached rooms and cached
itemdefinitions though. Within time, the caching will take up quite a big part.

- It is not a good idea to keep "amount" with the items, because it provides
a logistical nightmare, and makes it impossible (or difficult) to provide
unique abilities to certain items.

- It is better to have different itemtables, for rooms/items/characters, in
order to keep the primary key as best as possible. When moving items from
the table over to another table, it is best to:
1. retrieve itemids
2. remove itemids from table (reserving itemids)
3. add itemids to another table

Game Behaviour
--------------

- gold, silver and copper coins will be normal items. All values will be
counted using "copper". I.e. a copper coin is worth 1 copper coin. 1 silver
coin is worth 10 copper coins and 1 gold coin is worth 100 copper coins.

- When falling asleep, it is only possible for two commands to be used:
awaken or quit.

- Items and money, in most muds, seem to be available in great quantities.
This is in soo much a problem, that inflation makes everything generally
worthless. Possibilities to remedy this:
	- make worthless items easily obtainable, make valueable items rare
	- do not provide any mechanisms that "create" items. If no items are
	  created from scratch, no imbalance will be perpetrated. New items,
	  however, could be created using resources at ones disposal.
	  (fish, gloves, nice chair, etc.) However, make certain that it
	  takes a great amount of time and effort to correctly create a new 
	  item.
	- do not make shopkeepers accept all items, only those items they are
	  interested in, and then only if they haven't completely filled up
	  their stock yet. It is even possible to have shopkeepers decide to set
	  the price depending on the amount they have in stock.

- Destruction of items can take place:
	- items can be consumed by
		- eating
		- drinking
		- fire
		- "use" in general
		- time (i.e. wear/tear/perishables/etc)

- Items can change fundamentally. Certain items can change into different
items, for example a "new torch" can change into a "burnt stick".

- In order for characters to have special abilities that require additional
database information, we are unable at this time to add them using the
"attributes". It will require a different interface to be implemented on top
of the default Character class. A good example is ShopKeeper.
