<H1>Help on Boards</H1>
This functionality is used to display all available boards that are used for
discussions in the game.
<P>
Right now it is not possible to make any changes. If the need is there, I
will make it possible to add, delete or change boards.<P>
It is possible to remove messages due to offensive content. This can be done
by simply clicking the <I>Remove</I> link of the accompanying message. The
message remains in the database, fully intact, but when reading a board, the
message (and only the message) is replaced with the text <FONT
COLOR=red>[This message has been removed due to offensive content.]</FONT>.
<P>
<P><B>Note:</B> Bear in mind that the board called <I>logonmessage</I> is a
special case used to display logonmessages to users when entering the game.
This board should not be changed.
