The form can be used to enter either show or select sql statements that
query the database. For example:

<P><B>show tables</B><P>

<P><B>show fields from mm_usertable</B><P>

<P><B>select * from mm_usertable where name="Karn"</B><P>

<B>Note:</B> Please use this responsibly. If you decide to make a query that
shows all information of all users, you might end up with a really really
large webpage. And you might drag the performance of the computer down along
with it.<P>

contain which information in which fields, check <A
