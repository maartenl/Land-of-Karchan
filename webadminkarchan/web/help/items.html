<H1>Help on Items</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
Items are split up into itemdefinitions and items. Every item has exactly
one item definition, but one item definition can be applied to multiple
items.<P>
And example would be the item definition of a bucket, but there could be 10
buckets in the game, all with the same item definition.
<H2>Containers</H2>
Some special items are <I>containers</I>, that can contain other items.
There are two ways of defining an itemcontainer:
<UL><LI>in the item itself
<LI>in the item definition (in which case all items that use this item
definition are containers)
</UL>

<H2>Container Definition</H2>

First of all, and this is important, the container field must be set to
<I>yes</I> or all other fields regarding containers are ignored.<P>
The other fields are capacity, isopenable and keyid. Capacity is used to
indicate how much a container can carry. Isopenable indicates whether the
open and close command will work. If isopenable is false, it means that the
items is always open and does not need to be opened or closed.
<P>
Keyid is the item definition identification
number of the item that can be used to unlock/lock the lock of the
container. When empty, the container does not have a lock.

<H2>Container</H2>
A container (instance of a container item definition) will contain a number
of <I>attributes</I> that help remember the state of the container. For
example:
<DL>
<DT>isopenable
<DD>boolean, indicates wether or not the container can be opened and closed.
This overrides the isopenable field in the container definition itself.
<DT>isopen
<DD>boolean, indicates wether the container is open or closed.
<DT>islocked
<DD>boolean, indicates wether the container is locked or not. If no keyid is
present in the container definition, this field is ignored.
