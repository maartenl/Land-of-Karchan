<H1>Help on Bans</H1>

The game has the following rules dealing with banned people:
<OL>
<LI>if your characters name appears in the sillynames table, you are
<I>not</I> allowed to logon, otherwise see item 2.
<LI>if your characters name appears in the unbantable, you are allowed to
logon, otherwise see item 3.
<LI>if your ip/hostname matches any of the entries in the bantable, you are
<I>not</I> allowed to logon.
</OL>

<H2>Bantable</H2>

The bantable can be used to keep people from certain networkips/hostnames or
entire networks from logging onto tbe game. This is especially usefull if an
offender has a habit of circumventing the sillynamestable by creating new
characters all the time.<P>
The fields that can be filled out have the following meaning:
<DL>
<DT>address
<DD>the address of the computer or entire network that needs to be banned.
This is the field used by the game to check users.
<DT>days
<DD>the number of days that this ban should be active.
<DT>ip
<DD>the ip address or host name of the original offender. Purely
administrative in origin.
<DT>name
<DD>the name of the character of the original offender.
<DT>reason
<DD>the reason for the banishment.
</DL>

The <I>address</I> field can contain wildcards. Some examples are:<P>
<TT>user35622.cable.internet.com</TT> - one specific users computer<P>
<TT>%.cable.internet.com</TT> - one specific network<P>
<TT>%.com</TT> - the entire dot-com domain!!!

<H2>Sillynamestable</H2>
The sillynames table can also make use of wildcards. Convenient if you do
not wish to allow usernames that contain a certain (rather nasty swear)
word.<P>
For example: <TT>%bastard%</TT>
