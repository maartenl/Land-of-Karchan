Mud
</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This page contains most of the introductory information necessary for you to
get a similar Mud working like "<a href="http://www.karchan.org/">Land of
Karchan</a>". 

<h2>License</h2>
The license I use for the mud is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GPL</a>. As far as I know I am only using
existing GPL or LGPL software to create my own software so this should be no
problem.
<p>Why do I give
away the source code? Well, it's part of a new way of doing things. By keeping 
all source code private in the hands of companies you take away a
piece of knowledge of which a lot of people can benefit. Try looking at it
like instead of a company holding back the formula to the solution to a
disease, having the company give out the formula for public use, thereby
helping people all over the world. A lot of my source code is based upon
other people's source code, who basically did the same thing as me, thereby
creating a base on which I could build my mud.</p><p>

</p><h2>Documentation</h2>
The java documentation is available <a href="/javadoc">here</a>.



</p><h2>Source Code</h2>

You can view the source code itself <a href="/javasrc">here</A>.<p>

If you are interested in downloading the actual sourcecode, you can do so by
clicking <a href="/source/server.tgz">here.</A>

Bear in mind this is only the server source code. I'll see about adding the
other things as well.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Following stuff is required to compile my source code:
<ul>
<li>javac - the java compiler
</li><li>java - the java interpreter
</li><li>apache webserver - cgi-binaries are a first step to accessing the mud
</li><li>mysql - both the database as well as the C libraries
</li></ul>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
I'm giving you the source code of my mud in order for you to make something
original with it. There is a clear distantiation between my mud
(<i>Maarten's MUD</i>) and the <i>Land of Karchan</i>. While <i>Maarten's
Mud</i> does fall under the GPL, <i>Land of Karchan</i> does no such thing
and is copyrighted by me and others.
<p>
Have fun experimenting, and do send me an <a href="mailto:maarten_l@yahoo.com">email</a> if something is not
clear.</p><p>
