The table shows, in formal book-hand shape, all the letters that were
commonly used in Karchan. The arrangement is the one most usual at the time,
and the one in which the letters were then usually recited by name.<BR>
This script was not in origin an 'alphabet', that is, a haphazard series of
letters, each with an independent value of its own, recited in a traditional
order that has no reference either to their shapes or to their functions. It
was, rather, a system of consonantal signs, of similar shapes and style,
which could be adapted at choice or convenience to represent the consonants
of languages. None of the letters had in
itself a fixed value; but certain relations between them were gradually
recognized.<BR>
The system contained twenty-fout primary letters, 1-24 arrangers in four
<I>t&#233;mar</I> (series), each of which had six <I>tyeller</I> (grades).
There werer also 'additional letters', of which 25-36 are examples. Of these
27 and 29 are the only strictly independent letters; the remainder are
modifications of other letters. There was also a number of <I>tehtar</I>
(signs) of varied uses. These do not appear in the table.<BR>
The <I>primary letters</I> were each formed of a <I>telco</I> (stem) and a
<I>l&#250;va</I> (bow). The forms seen in 1-4 were regarded as normal. The
stem could be raised, as in 9-16; or reduced, as in 17-24. The bow could be
open, as in Series I and III; or closed as in II and IV; and in either case
it could be doubled, as e.g. in 5-8.<BR>
The theoretic freedom of application had been modified by custom to this
extent that Series I was generally applied to the dental or <I>t</I>-series
(<I>tincot&#233;ma</I>), and II to the labials or <I>p</I>-series
(<I>parmat&#233;ma</I>). The application of Series III and IV varied
according to the requirements of different languages.<P>

In languages, which make much use of consonants such as our <I>chi, j,
sh</I>, Series III was usually applied to these; in which case Series IV was
applied to the normal <I>k</I>-series (<I>calmat&#233;ma</I>). In Quenya,
which possessed besides the <I>calmat&#233;ma</I> both a palatal series
(<I>tyelpet&#233;ma</I>) and labialized sseries (<I>quesset&#233;ma</I>),
the palatals were represented by a diacritic denoting 'following y' (usually
two underposed dots), while Series IV was a <I>kw</I>-series.<P>

Within these general appications the following relations were also commonly
observed. The normal letters, Grade 1, were applied to the 'voiceless
stops': </I>t, p, l,<I> etc. The doubling of the bow indicated the addition
of 'voice': thus if 1, 2, 3, 4 = <I>t, p, ch, k</I> (or <I>t, p, k, kw</I>)
then 5, 6, 7, 8 = <I>d, b, j, g</I> (or <I>d, b, g, gw</I>). The raising of the 
stem indicated the opening of the consonants to a 'spirant': thus assuming
the above values for Grade 1, Grade 3 (9-12) = <I>th, f, sh, ch</I> (or
<I>th, f, kh, khw/hw</I>), and Grade 4 (13-16) = <I>dh, v, zh, gh</I> (or
<I>dh, v, gh, ghw/w</I>).<BR>
The original system also possessed a grade with extended stems, both above
and below the line. These usually represented aspirated consonants (e.g.
t+h, p+h, k+h), but migt represent other consonantal variations required.
They were not needed in the earlier languages; but the extended forms were
much used as variant (more clearly distinguished from Grade 1) of Grades 3
and 4.<BR>
Grade 5 (17-20) was usually applied to the nasal consonants: thus 17 and 19
were the most common signs for n and m. According to the principle observed
above, Grade 6 should then have represented the voiceless nasals; but since
such sounds exemplified by Welsh <I>nh</I> or ancient English <I>hn</I>)
were of very rare occurrence in the languages concerned, Grade 6 (21-24) was
most often used for the weakest or 'semi-vocalic' consonants of each series.
It consisted of the smallest and simplest shapes among the primary letters.
Thus 21 was often used for a weak (untrilled) <I>r</I>, originally occurring
in Quenya and regarded in the system of that language as the weakest
consonant of the <I>tincot^#233;ma</I>; 22 was widely used for <I>w</I>;
where Series III was used as a palatal series 23 was commonly used as
consonantal <I>y</I>.<P>

Since some of the consonants of Grade 4 tended to become weaker in
pronunciation, and to approach or to merge with those of Grade 6 (as
described above), many of the latter ceased to have a clear function in the
languages, and it was from these letters that the letters expressing vowels
were largely derived.<P>
